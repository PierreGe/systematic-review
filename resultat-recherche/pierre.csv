Recent work on fully functional temporal process regression (TPR) offers great flexibility by allowing all the regression coefficients to be nonparametrically time varying. The existing estimation procedure", however, prevents successive goodness-of-fit test for covariate coefficients in comparing a sequence of nested models. This article proposes a partly functional TPR model in the line of marginal mean models. Some covariate effects are time independent while others are completely unspecified in time. This class of models is very rich, including the fully functional model and the semiparametric model as special cases. To estimate the parameters, we propose semiparametric profile estimating equations, which are solved via an iterative algorithm, starting at a consistent estimate from a fully functional model in the existing work. No smoothing is needed, in contrast to other varying-coefficient methods. The weak convergence of the resultant estimators are developed using the empirical process theory. Successive tests of time-varying effects and backward model selection procedure can then be carried out. The practical usefulness of the methodology is demonstrated through a simulation study and a real example of recurrent exacerbation among cystic fibrosis patients.

The Multiple Query problem (MQ, for short) is a 5-tuple (Q, A, D, Ï†, â_•), where Q is a set of queries, A is a set of items, D is a set of solutions, Ï†: Q Ã— A â†’ D is a function, and â_• is a commutative and associative binary operator over D. The input to the MQ problem consists of a sequence Q = ã€ˆq 1, q 2,..., q mã€‰ of m queries from Q and of a sequence A = ã€ˆa 1, a 2,... a nã€‰ of n items from A. The goal is to compute, for every query q i (1 â‰_ i â‰_ m) its solution defined as Ï†(q i, A) = Ï†(q i,a 1) â_• Ï†(q i, a 2) â_•...â_• Ï†(q i, a n). We begin by discussing a generic algorithm that solves a large class of MQ problems in O(âˆ_m + f(n)) time on a reconfigurable mesh of size âˆ_n Ã— âˆ_n, where f(n) is the time necessary to compute the expression d 1 â_• d 2 â_•...â_• d n with d i âˆˆ D on such a platform. We then go on to show that the MQ framework affords us an optimal algorithm for the multiple point location problem on a reconfigurable mesh of size âˆ_n Ã— âˆ_n. Given a set A of n points and a set Q of m (m â‰_ n) points in the plane, our algorithm reports, in O(âˆ_m + log log n) time, all points of Q that lie inside the convex hull of A. Quite surprisingly, our algorithm solves the multiple point location problem without computing the convex hull of A which, in itself, takes Î©(âˆ_n) time on a reconfigurable mesh of size âˆ_n Ã— âˆ_n. Finally, we prove an Î©(âˆ_m + g(n)) time lower bound for nontrivial MQ problems, where g(n) is the lower bound for evaluating the expression d 1 â_• d 2 â_•...â_• d n with d i âˆˆ D," on a reconfigurable mesh of size âˆ_n Ã— âˆ_n.""

To this end, we encode the properties defining the correct behavior of a pattern as LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formulae and the sequence diagram representing the possible interaction traces among the objects involved in the candidate instances as PROMELA specifications. To verify whether the LTL properties are satisfied by the candidates we employ the SPIN model checking tool.

Source-level linkage is different from compilation linkage. Its goal is to assist a software engineer, not to produce an executable program. Thus a source-level linker needs to collect as many as possible facts that may be potentially helpful to a software engineer's task, many of which are not available from a compiler linker. We present the design of a source-level linker for C++. This linker has been used to analyze a dozen of Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) programs and over 200 C++ programs that cover an extensive subset of C++ features, including templates from the Standard Template Library (STL).

Pattern fidelity issues and masks defects that were once considered insignificant or merely nuisances are now yield-limiting. On the other hand, there are still cases of small defects captured during reticle inspection but will not print on the wafer. In addition, in a production setting environment it is critical to ascertain quickly and efficiently the true lithographic effect of reticle defects in order to avoid yield and cycle time impacts. As a starting point, it is best to inspect the reticle at the highest sensitivity to find all defects and anomalies. From there, fast and efficient means to sort and prioritize defects are necessary for inspection operators' and engineers' convenience. Then, it is critical to model all the defects accurately for their lithographic impact. Finally," an accurate lithographybased set of reticle defect disposition criteria can be developed for the manufacturing process flow. The focus of this study is on contact or hole patterns since the issues regarding capture of defects on such patterns are typically more complex than the ones on line and space patterns.

The basic parameters of steady-state voltage control mode are designed and its voltage regulating range and effect on grid voltage are analyzed. The STATCOM transient voltage control logic is designed based on the specific analysis of power grid faults and it is pointed out that, the active blocking state with zero reactive power can be entered in case of near-end fault. The comparison between daily grid voltage curve and STATCOM reactive power curve confirms that, STATCOM regulates the grid voltage in real time by tracking it in the steady-state voltage control mode.

The workflows developed based on this new class of reservoir simulation and modeling tools break new ground in modeling fluid flow through porous media by providing a completely new and different angle on reservoir simulation and modeling. The philosophy behind this modeling approach and its major commonalities and differences with numerical and analytical models are explored and two different categories of such models are explained. Details of this technology are presented using examples of most recent applications to several prolific reservoirs in the Middle East and in the Gulf of Mexico.AI-based Reservoir Models can be developed for green or brown fields. Since these models are developed based on spatio-temporal databases that are specifically developed for this purpose", they require the existence of a basic numerical reservoir simulator for the green fields while can be developed entirely based on historical data for brown fields. The run-time of AI-based Reservoir Models that provide complete field responses is measured in seconds rather than hours and days (even for a multi-million grid block reservoir). Therefore, providing means for fast track reservoir analysis and AI-assisted history matching are intrinsic characteristics of these models. AI-based Reservoir Models can, in some cases, completely substitute numerical reservoir simulation models, work side by side but completely independent or be integrated with them in order to increase their productivity.Advantages associated with AI-based Reservoir Models are short development time, low development cost," fast track analysis and practical capability to quantify the uncertainties associated with the static model. AI-based Reservoir Model includes a novel design tool for comprehensive analysis of the full field and design of field development strategies to meet operational targets. They have open data requirement architecture that can accommodate a wide variety of data from pressure tests to seismic. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.""

RML is general because it enables the manipulation not only of graphs (i.e., binary relations), but of relations of arbitrary arity. CrocoPat executes RML programs efficiently because it internally represents relations as binary decision diagrams, a data structure that is well-known as a compact representation of large relations in computer-aided verification. We evaluate RML by giving example programs for several software analyses and CrocoPat by comparing its performance with calculators for binary relations," a Prolog system and a relational database management system.

It involves computer science, artificial intelligence, 3D computation, engineering system modelling, analysis and simulation, bionics engineering, automatic control, image processing and pattern recognition etc. Among them, face detection belongs to image processing and pattern recognition. An emotional robot must have the ability to recognize various objects, particularly, it is very important for a bio-robot to be able to recognize human faces from an image. In this paper, a face detection method is proposed for identifying any human faces in colour images using human skin model and eye detection method. Firstly, this method can be used to detect skin regions from the input colour image after normalizing its luminance. Then, all face candidates are identified using an eye detection method. Comparing with existing algorithms, this method only relies on the colour and geometrical data of human face rather than using training datasets. From experimental results," it is shown that this method is effective and fast and it can be applied to the development of an emotional bio-robot with further improvements of its speed and accuracy.

Estimating the actual proportion of data from the input data stream could allow to dynamically adapt ensembles to reflect operational conditions. In this paper, the selection and fusion of ensembles produced through Boolean Combination (BC) of classifiers is periodically adapted based on the class proportions estimated from input streams. BC techniques have been shown to efficiently integrate the responses of multiple diversified classifiers in the ROC space, yet the impact on performance of imbalanced data distributions is difficult to observe from ROC curves. Given a diversified pool of classifiers and a desired false positive rate (fpr), the new Skew-Sensitive Boolean Combination (SSBC) technique exploits the Precision-Recall Operating Characteristic (PROC) space, leading to a higher level of performance. A set of BCs of base classifiers is initially produced with imbalanced reference data in the PROC space, where each BC curve corresponds to different level of imbalance (a growing number of non-target samples versus a fixed number of target ones). Then, during operations, the closest adjacent levels of class imbalance are periodically estimated using the Hellinger distance between the data distribution of inputs and that of imbalance levels, and used to approximate the most accurate BC of classifiers from operational points of these curves. Simulation results on Faces In Action video surveillance data indicate that ensemble-based FR systems using the SSBC technique outperform the same systems using traditional BC techniques with Random Under-Sampling and One-Sided Selection. It allows to dynamically select BCs that provide a higher level of precision (and F1 value) for target individuals, and a significantly smaller difference between desired and actual fpr. Performance of this adaptive approach is also comparable to the costly full recalculation of BCs (as required by a BC technique to accommodate a specific level of imbalance), but for a computational complexity that is considerably lower. Finally," SSBC is shown to achieve a high level of discrimination between target and non-target individuals when face tracking is exploited to accumulate ensemble predictions for facial captures that correspond to a same person in the video scene.

In particular, recognizing design patterns in the software can provide reverse engineers with considerable insight on the software structure and its internal characteristics. Researchers have therefore proposed techniques based on static analysis to automatically recover design patterns in a program. Unfortunately, most design patterns comprise not only structural, but also significant behavioral aspects. Although static analysis is well suited for the recognition of structural aspects, it is typically limited and imprecise in analyzing behavior. To address this limitation, we present a new technique that complements our existing static analysis with a dynamic analysis, so as to perform a more accurate design-pattern recognition. The dynamic analysis is based on (1) transforming behavioral aspects of design patterns into finite automata, (2) identifying and instrumenting relevant method calls," and (3) monitoring relevant calls at runtime and matching them against the automata. The results of the dynamic analysis are then used to compute the likelihood of a pattern to be in the code. This paper describes our technique and presents a preliminary empirical study performed to assess the technique.

Unfortunately, conventional caches typically employ fixed cache line sizes to balance the exploitation of spatial and temporal locality, and to avoid prohibitive cache fill bandwidth demands. The resulting inability of conventional caches to exploit spatial variations leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary cache power dissipation. This paper describes the Spatial Pattern Predictor (SPP), a cost-effective hardware mechanism that accurately predicts reference patterns within a spatial group (i.e., a contiguous region of data in memory) at runtime. The key observation enabling an accurate, yet low-cost, SPP design is that spatial patterns correlate well with instruction addresses and data reference offsets within a cache line. We require only a small amount of predictor memory to store the predicted patterns. Simulation results for a 64-Kbyte 2-way set-associative L1 data cache with 64-byte lines show that: (1) a 256-entry tag-less direct-mapped SPP can achieve, on average, a prediction coverage of 95%, over-predicting the patterns by only 8%, (2) assuming a 70nm process technology, the SPP helps reduce leakage energy in the base cache by 41% on average, incurring less than 1% performance degradation," and (3) prefetching spatial groups of up to 512 bytes using SPP improves execution time by 33% on average and up to a factor of two.""

Firstly, the original small texture is segmented into layers, each of which contains one particular texture element. Secondly, each layer is deformed using a set of chaotic-based transformation operations. Thirdly, all the deformed layers are added together to form a new texture, which is a natural variation of the original sample texture. Since each layer is deformed independently, adding the deformed layers together usually results in a texture with overlapping regions and holes. We employ the graphcut algorithm and an example-based image inpainting technique to seamlessly patch the overlapping regions and to fill the holes. Moreover, an optimized graphcut synthesis algorithm and a new cyclic texture synthesis technique are also developed for efficiently creating large seamless textures.

For their application over a wide wavelength range, achromatization is planned for diffractive-type optical diffusers. A diffracted pattern can be achromatized by fixing the ratio of each optical path area and optimizing the multiwavelength diffracted patterns simultaneously. Subwavelength pillar structures are used for multilevel optical path regions. We fabricated test pieces to demonstrate this method. Patterns were formed by KrF and ArF stepper lithography and dry etching, and then replicated to resin by UV nanoimprint. Simulations and measurements gave similar results," which suggests that these methods for achromatization work well.

Reversible logic is emerging as a promising computing paradigm with applications in low-power quantum computing and QCA in the field of very large scale integration (VLSI) design. In this paper", we worked on conservative logic gate (CLG) and reversible logic gate (RLG). We examined that RLG and CLG are two classes of logic family intersecting each other. The intersection of RLG and CLG is parity preserving reversible (PPR) or conservative reversible logic gate (CRLG). We proposed in this paper, three algorithms to find different k Ã— k RLG as well as CLG. Here, we demonstrate only the most promising two proposed gates of different categories. We compared the results with that of the previous Fredkin gate. The result shows that logic synthesis using above two gates will be a promising step towards the low-power QCA design era.

In particular, the IL emphasizes the role of music as a navigation aid in a VE. This paper reports three user-evaluations of different IL enriched virtual worlds, and in particular of the role of the IL auditory component. Results suggest that audio in 3D plays not only an aesthetic role, which the users greatly appreciate, but also a functional role simplifying navigation and helping the users to recognise scenes in the environment. Such a functional role however is subordinated to a proper understanding of the link between music and virtual space.

Not surprisingly, the decision to develop a DSL is often postponed indefinitely, if considered at all, and most DSLs never get beyond the application library stage. Although many articles have been written on the development of particular DSLs, there is very limited literature on DSL development methodologies and many questions remain regarding when and how to develop a DSL. To aid the DSL developer, we identify patterns in the decision, analysis, design, and implementation phases of DSL development. Our patterns improve and extend earlier work on DSL design patterns.

This work proposes a multi-level design approach to deal with the issue of designing large neighborhood based operators. The main idea is inspired from stacked generalization (a multi-level classifier design approach) and consists in, at each training level," combining the outcomes of the previous level operators. The final operator is a multi-level operator that ultimately depends on a larger neighborhood than of the individual operators that have been combined. Experimental results show that two-level operators obtained by combining operators designed on subwindows of a large window consistently outperforms the single-level operators designed on the full window. They also show that iterating two-level operators is an effective multi-level approach to obtain better results. Â© 2009 IEEE.""

It combines design pattern candidate sets coming from different tools implementing different DPD techniques. We show that a design pattern can be a witness for the existence of another pattern. Our approach is able (1) to provide correct diagnostics even if the inputs from the evaluated tools were partly wrong and (2) to detect patterns instances not identified by the individual tools. For the Decorator, Visitor and Observer pattern, the witness-based approach yields better precision and recall than provided by any single tool. In particular, it detects 24 out of 30 instances of these patterns missed in our experiments by the evaluated tools.

However", existing pattern detection methodologies generally have problems in dealing with one or more of the following issues: identification of modified pattern versions, search space explosion for large systems and extensibility to novel patterns. In this paper, a design pattern detection methodology is proposed that is based on similarity scoring between graph vertices. Due to the nature of the underlying graph algorithm, this approach has the ability to also recognize patterns that are modified from their standard representation. Moreover, the approach exploits the fact that patterns reside in one or more inheritance hierarchies, reducing the size of the graphs to which the algorithm is applied. Finally, the algorithm does not rely on any pattern-specific heuristic," facilitating the extension to novel design structures. Evaluation on three open-source projects demonstrated the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method. Â© 2006 IEEE.""

While researchers have proposed algorithms for recognizing bad patterns in design", they did not consider composition of design pattern instances. In practice, designers compose design pattern instances in solving their design problems. In this paper, we illustrate that good pattern instances can be composed to result in bad ones, while bad pattern instances can be composed to result in good ones. Based on this argument, a pattern-based design improvement approach should be able to recognize composite design patterns instead of just design patterns. As a basis for developing this type of approaches, we suggest a hierarchical model to capture the composite relationships among good and bad patterns. In addition, we define a concept called refinement pattern, which captures possible improvements to bad patterns. This hierarchical model can offer a number of advantages, including rejection of non-informative constituent pattern instances, compactness in the representation of design patterns," reducing complexity in pattern matching by reducing number of constraints to be matched and providing improvement suggestions to bad patterns.""

Design patterns abstract reusable object-oriented software designs which are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. Each pattern solves design problems that occur in every day development. The detection of design patterns during the process of software reverse engineering can provide a better understanding of the software system. The most recent approaches in design pattern detection rely on the abstract syntax tree representation of the source code for fact extraction. This paper proposes a new way to detect design pattern in Java applications by analyzing the java source code. This paper discussed about the relations both between classes and objects and established the derivative design pattern about model property. Using the roles", responsibilities and collaboration information of each design pattern define static definitions. The static definitions are used to find candidate instances during the static analysis by using BCEL. After the static analysis the found candidate instances are validated by using the dynamic behavior of design patterns. We instrument the Java byte code of the application we are analyzing with additional code fragments and extract method traces from the running application. These method traces represent the dynamic facts of an application. The several restrictions are presented to define design patterns dynamically. Four common patterns of original GoF design patterns are tested and the results are analyzed which give better results in detecting design patterns comparing with other tools. In addition a Java source code static checking tool, an Eclipse plug-in, is implemented. Finally several java applications source codes were analyzed by using the plug-in," and verified the feasibility of the approach. Â© 2013 IEEE.""

Rules are characterized by weights indicating their importance in the detection of a specific design pattern. The core behavior of each design pattern may be described through a subset of these rules forming a macrorule. Macrorules define the main traits of a pattern. JADEPT (JAva DEsign Pattern deTector) is our software for design pattern identification based on this idea. It captures static and dynamic aspects through a dynamic analysis of the software by exploiting the JPDA (Java Platform Debugger Architecture). The extracted information is stored in a database.

Accurately recovered instances of structural design patterns support development related tasks like program comprehension and reengineering. However", the detection of structural design pattern instances is not always a straightforward task. The lack of documentation, the ad-hoc nature of programming and the possible variants of pattern instances often lead to the low accuracy of detection. In this paper, we present an approach to the detection of instances of structural design patterns using source codes. We first transform the source codes and predefined patterns into graphs, with the classes as nodes and the relations as edges. We then identify the instances of sub-patterns that would be the possible constituents of pattern instances by means of subgraph discovery. The sub-pattern instances are further merged by joint classes to see if the collective matches one of the predefined patterns. Compared with existing approaches, our approach focuses on simple sub-patterns, not complicated patterns. In this way, it can not only simplify the detection process, but also detect multiple pattern instances at a time. The results of the experiments on detecting pattern instances of Adapter, Bridge, Composite," Decorator and Proxy from 4 open source software systems demonstrate that our approach obtains better precision than the existing approaches.

We propose a novel approach to the formal definition of design patterns that is based on the idea that design patterns are knowledge that is shared across a community and that is by nature distributed and inconsistent. By using the web ontology language (OWL) we are able to formally define design patterns and some related concepts such as pattern participant, pattern refinement, and pattern instance. We discuss the respective ontology and give examples of how patterns can be defined using this ontology. We present the prototype of a Java client that accesses the pattern definitions and detects patterns in Java software," and analyse some scan results.

In this way, we can obtain a large amount of images resembling real documents by simply defining the set of constraints and providing a few pre-defined backgrounds. As documents are synthetically generated, the groundtruth (the location and the label of every symbol) becomes automatically available. We have applied this approach to the generation of a large database of architectural drawings and electronic diagrams," which shows the flexibility of the system.

The workflows developed based on this new class of reservoir simulation and modeling tools break new ground in modeling fluid flow through porous media by providing a completely new and different angle on reservoir simulation and modeling. The philosophy behind this modeling approach and its major commonalities and differences with numerical and analytical models are explored and two different categories of such models are explained. Details of this technology are presented using examples of most recent applications to several prolific reservoirs in the Middle East and in the Gulf of Mexico. AI-Based reservoir models can be developed for green or brown fields. Since these models are developed based on spatio-temporal databases that are specifically developed for this purpose", they require the existence of a basic numerical reservoir simulator for the green fields while can be developed entirely based on historical data for brown fields. The run-time of AI-Based reservoir models that provide complete field responses is measured in seconds rather than minutes and hours (even for a multi-million grid block reservoir). Therefore, providing means for fast track reservoir analysis and AI-assisted history matching are intrinsic characteristics of these models. AI-Based Reservoir Models can completely substitute numerical reservoir simulation models, work side by side but completely independent or be integrated with them in order to increase their productivity. Advantages associated with AI-Based Reservoir Models are short development time, low development cost, fast track analysis and have the practical capability to quantify the uncertainties associated with the static model. AI-Based Reservoir Model includes a novel design tool for comprehensive analysis of the full field and design of field development strategies to meet operational targets. They have open data requirement architecture that can accommodate a wide variety of data from pressure tests to seismic. Copyright 2011," Society of Petroleum Engineers.""

The application of design patterns leads to their personalization to a specific context", hence to the generation of variants. This makes their recognition a challenging task, which may be addressed through the understanding and detection of the micro-structures design patterns are made of. This is very useful for the detection as well as for the application of design patterns. The principal aim of this paper is to present a survey on these micro-structures and a comparison among them in the perspective of reverse engineering. Because of their less complex structure and behavior, as well as closer link to the source code, the recognition of these micro-structures may be automated, which can be considered a step towards the automatic recognition of the more complex design patterns. In this paper, we consider four of the most significant types of micro-structures: elemental design patterns, clues, sub-patterns, and micro patterns. To analyze the role of the micro-structures in the design pattern detection process, we make a comparison among these four types of micro-structures and among the micro-structures of various types in order to identify the relations among them.

It has been recognized that mining techniques developed for pattern recognition such as Clustering and Visualization can assist in designing data warehouse schema. However, a suitable methodology is required for the seamless integration of mining methods in the design of warehouse schema. In previous work, we presented a methodology that employs hierarchical clustering to derive a tree structure that can be used by a data warehouse designer to build a schema. We believe that, in order to strengthen the decision making process," there is a strong need for a method that automatically extracts knowledge present at different levels of abstraction from a warehouse. We demonstrate with examples how mining at different levels of a hierarchical warehouse schema can give new insights about the underlying data cluster which not only helps in building more meaningful dimensions and facts for data warehouse design but can also improve the decision making process.

Therefore, one of the challenging issues is conformance checking of source code and design, i.e., design patterns. In addition, after developing a system, usually its documents are not maintained, so, identifying design pattern from source code can help to achieve the design of an existing system as a reverse engineering task. The variant implementations (i.e., different source codes) of a design pattern make hard to detect the design pattern instances from the source code. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a new method which aims to map the design pattern detection problem into a learning problem. The proposed design pattern detector is made by learning from the information extracted from design pattern instances which normally include variant implementations. To evaluate the proposed method," we applied it on open source codes to detect six different design patterns. The experimental results show that the proposed method is promising and effective.

The proposed framework consists of user interface for interactions, immersive virtual environment, and networking interface. In this framework, we adopt several design patterns to guarantee that either developers or users (artists) can easily implement their VR applications without strong knowledge of VR techniques such as programming, libraries etc. One of the key features of this framework is the presence of the device module which supports a natural user interaction in a virtual environment. For example, the proposed framework provides users with tangible objects so that the users are able to manipulate virtual objects by touching real objects. The proposed framework also supports large scale stereoscopic display through clustering technique.

This study investigates the effect of the involuntary motor activity of paretic-spastic muscles on the classification of surface electromyography (EMG) signals. Approach. Two data collection sessions were designed for 8 stroke subjects to voluntarily perform 11 functional movements using their affected forearm and hand at relatively slow and fast speeds. For each stroke subject", the degree of involuntary motor activity present in the voluntary surface EMG recordings was qualitatively described from such slow and fast experimental protocols. Myoelectric pattern recognition analysis was performed using different combinations of voluntary surface EMG data recorded from the slow and fast sessions. Main results. Across all tested stroke subjects, our results revealed that when involuntary surface EMG is absent or present in both the training and testing datasets, high accuracies (>96%, >98%, respectively, averaged over all the subjects) can be achieved in the classification of different movements using surface EMG signals from paretic muscles. When involuntary surface EMG was solely involved in either the training or testing datasets, the classification accuracies were dramatically reduced (<89%, <85%, respectively). However, if both the training and testing datasets contained EMG signals with the presence and absence of involuntary EMG interference," high accuracies were still achieved (>97%). Significance. The findings of this study can be used to guide the appropriate design and implementation of myoelectric pattern recognition based systems or devices toward promoting robot-aided therapy for stroke rehabilitation.

Our formulation is motivated by applications to scene interpretation in which there are a great many possible explanations for the data"," one (""""background"""") is statistically dominant", and it is imperative to restrict intensive computation to genuinely ambiguous regions. The focus here is then on pattern filtering: Given a large set y, of possible patterns or explanations, narrow down the true one Y to a small (random) subset YÌŒ â_‚ y," of """"detected"""" patterns to be subjected to further", more intense, processing. To this end, we consider a family of hypothesis tests for Y âˆˆ A versus the nonspecific alternatives Y âˆˆ A c. Each test has null type I error and the candidate sets A â_‚ y, are arranged in a hierarchy of nested partitions. These tests are then characterized by scope (|A|), power (or type II error) and algorithmic cost. We consider sequential testing strategies in which decisions are made iteratively, based on past outcomes," about which test to perform next and when to stop testing. The set YÌŒ is then taken to be the set of patterns that have not been ruled out by the tests performed. The total cost of a strategy is the sum of the """"testing cost"""" and the """"postprocessing cost"""" (proportional to |YÌŒ|) and the corresponding optimization problem is analyzed. As might be expected", under mild assumptions good designs for sequential testing strategies exhibit a steady progression from broad scope coupled with low power to high power coupled with dedication to specific explanations. In the assumptions ensuring this property a key role is played by the ratio cost/power. These ideas are illustrated in the context of detecting rectangles amidst clutter.

While several design pattern detection tools presented in the literature are capable of detecting design patterns automatically", evaluating these detection results is usually done in a manual and subjective fashion. Differences in design pattern definitions, as well as pattern instance counting and presenting, exacerbate the difficulty of evaluating design pattern detection results. In this paper, we present a novel approach to evaluating and comparing design pattern detection results. Our approach, called MoRe, introduces a novel way to present design pattern instances in a uniform fashion. Based on this characterization of design pattern instances, we propose four measures for design pattern detection evaluation that convey a concise assessment of the quality of the results produced by a given detection method.

In the serial approach, component classifiers are created by focusing on different parts of the training set in different learning phases. In contrast, without paying special attention to any part of the dataset, the parallel approach generates classifiers independently. By integrating these two techniques and by using a neural network approach for the base classifier, this work proposes a design method for a two-stage committee machine. In the first stage of the approach the entire dataset is used to train an averaging ensemble. Based on the classification results of this first stage, hard-to-classify samples are selected and sent to the second stage. To improve the classification accuracy for these samples," a computationally more intensive bagging ensemble is employed in the second stage. These two neural network ensembles work in series whereas the component neural networks in each of the ensembles are trained in parallel.

The cascadable structure of proposed n-cell PRPG is utilized to construct the (n + 1)-cell PRPG, in two time steps, without sacrificing the pseudorandomness quality.

Typically", the design-process weak-points, also referred as design hotspots, are classified into patterns of fixed size. The size of the pattern defines the radius of influence for the process. These fixed sized patterns are used to search and detect process weak points in new designs without running computationally expensive process simulations. However, both the complexity of the pattern and different kinds of physical processes affect the radii of influence. Therefore, there is a need to determine the optimal pattern radius (size) for efficient hotspot detection. The methodology described here uses a combination of pattern classification and pattern search techniques to create a directed graph, referred to as the Pattern Association Tree (PAT). The pattern association tree is then filtered based on the relevance, sensitivity and context area of each pattern node. The critical patterns are identified by traversing the tree and ranking the patterns. This method has plausible applications in various areas such as process characterization," physical design verification and physical design optimization. Our initial experiments in the area of physical design verification confirm that a pattern deck with the radius optimized for each pattern is significantly more accurate at predicting design hotspots when compared to a conventional deck of fixed sized patterns.

In order to meet strict accuracy, integrity, continuity, and availability goals in the presence of hostile jamming and in a harsh multipath environment, advanced technologies are required. One of those being studied is a controlled reception pattern antenna (CRPA) array with beam steering/adaptive null forming capabilities. The Stanford University GPS Laboratory has developed a software tool to study CRPA algorithms and their effects on GPS signal and tracking characteristics. A testbed has been constructed to investigate hardware issues including the phase center offset of the antenna elements and mutual coupling effects. This testbed consists of a 3 element antenna array with a baseline of 1m, using high-quality survey-grade or lower-quality patch antennas. Data has been taken using this array in conjunction with sufficient satellite constellation and antenna array motion to ensure complete azimuth and elevation signal coverage. A carrier phase-based attitude determination algorithm was used to generate inter-antenna bias residuals, allowing characterization of the virtual phase center of the array. Repeating the testing procedure both with survey-grade antennas, for which the phase center characteristics are well known, and with a patch antenna possessing unknown phase center behavior, allows characterization of the azimuth- and elevation-dependent properties of the patch antenna phase center. In addition," mutual coupling effects have been investigated by adding inactive patch elements around the active patch antenna.

This interference can significantly limit prediction accuracy. In current predictor designs, the branches sharing prediction information are determined by their branch addresses and thus branch groups are arbitrarily chosen during compilation. This feasibility study explores a more analytic and systematic approach to classify branches into clusters with similar behavioral characteristics. We present several ways to incorporate this cluster information as an additional information source in branch predictors. Our profile-based results demonstrate that cluster information is useful in various branch prediction schemes. When clustered indexing is applied, the same performance can be obtained with 2-8 times less hardware budget. For small predictor budgets, clustered indexing is very cost-effective, e.g., the misprediction rate in an 8 Kib gshare is reduced 12.3% on average for SPEC CPU2000 INT. For large budgets up to 4 Mib, clustered indexing reduces the number of mispredictions by 3-5%," or stated otherwise only half the hardware budget is required to obtain the same performance as the original gshare scheme.

The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications. Copyright Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons," Ltd.""

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of modafinil on non-verbal cognitive functions in healthy volunteers, with a particular focus on variations of cognitive load, measures of motivational factors and the effects on creative problem-solving. Methods: A double-blind placebo-controlled parallel design study evaluated the effect of 200 mg of modafinil (N = 32) or placebo (N = 32) in non-sleep deprived healthy volunteers. Non-verbal tests of divergent and convergent thinking were used to measure creativity. A new measure of task motivation was used, together with more levels of difficulty on neuropsychological tests from the CANTAB battery. Results: Improvements under modafinil were seen on spatial working memory, planning and decision making at the most difficult levels, as well as visual pattern recognition memory following delay. Subjective ratings of enjoyment of task performance were significantly greater under modafinil compared with placebo, but mood ratings overall were not affected. The effects of modafinil on creativity were inconsistent and did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Modafinil reliably enhanced task enjoyment and performance on several cognitive tests of planning and working memory," but did not improve paired associates learning. The findings confirm that modafinil can enhance aspects of highly demanding cognitive performance in non-sleep deprived individuals.

Many computational methods in this area focus on measuring the structural similarities between chemical structures. However", traditional similarity measures are often too rigid or consider only global similarities between structures. The maximum common substructure (MCS) approach provides a more promising and flexible alternative for predicting bioactive compounds. Results: In this article, a new backtracking algorithm for MCS is proposed and compared to global similarity measurements. Our algorithm provides high flexibility in the matching process, and it is very efficient in identifying local structural similarities. To predict and cluster biologically active compounds more efficiently, the concept of basis compounds is proposed that enables researchers to easily combine the MCS-based and traditional similarity measures with modern machine learning techniques. Support vector machines (SVMs) are used to test how the MCS-based similarity measure and the basis compound vectorization method perform on two empirically tested datasets. The test results show that MCS complements the well-known atom pair descriptor-based similarity measure. By combining these two measures," our SVM-based model predicts the biological activities of chemical compounds with higher specificity and sensitivity. Â© 2008 The Author(s).""

As the generalisation of the Fourier transform (FT), the linear canonical transform (LCT) has received much attention, and has found many applications in filter design, pattern recognition, optics and so on. In this study, the authors define a new kind of AF - the AF based on the LCT (LCTAF), which is proposed to estimate the CP signal. Some important properties of LCTAF are discussed, such as symmetry and conjugation property, shifting property and Moyal formula. The relationships between the LCTAF and other time-frequency analysis distributions are derived, including the classical AF, the Wigner distribution function (WDF) based on LCT, the short-FT and the wavelet transform.

The thermodynamic reaction mechanism", phase composition and microstructure of the materials, as well as the optimization of its process under multi-variable coupling participation were investigated. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the phases in samples during heat treatment with the increase of sintering temperature will transform from any impurity phases including O' phase and X phase to Î_ phase, and from Î_ phase even to other high-temperature nitride phase involving 15 R, 12 H-sialon, and Si3N4, AlN. So it may result in the complexity in designing for optimal synthesized process. The analysis of orthogonal test indicates that the obtaining of high content of Î_-sialon with elongated grains depends significantly on both the holding time and sintering temperature. The optimizing zone of performance can be rapidly found by pattern recognition. The 100% sialon phase material is obtained by sintering at 1500Â°C for 5 h.

The idea behind our solution is to identify a set of rules capturing information necessary to identify a design pattern instance. Rules are characterized by weights indicating their importance in the detection of a specific design pattern. The core behavior of each design pattern may be described through a subset of these rules forming a macrorule. Macrorules define the main traits of a pattern. JADEPT (JAva DEsign Pattern deTector) is our software for design pattern identification based on this idea. It captures static and dynamic aspects through a dynamic analysis of the software by exploiting the JPDA (Java Platform Debugger Architecture). The extracted information is stored in a database. Queries to the database implement the rules defined to recognize the design patterns.

RAPPID uses a synchronous 0.25 micron CMOS library for static and domino logic, and has no Design-for-Test hooks other than some debug features. We explore the use of Cellular Automata (CA) for on-chip test pattern generation and response evaluation. More specifically, we look for fast ways to tune the CA-BIST to the RAPPID design, rather than using pseudo-random testing. The metric for tuning the CA-BIST pattern generation is based on an abstract hardware description model of the instruction length decoder, which is independent of implementation details, and hence also independent of the asynchronous circuit style. Our CA-BIST solution uses a novel bootstrap procedure for generating the test patterns, which give complete coverage for this metric," and cover 94% of the testable stuck-at faults for the actual design at switch level. Analysis of the undetected and untestable faults shows that the same fault effects can be expected for a similar clocked circuit. This is encouraging evidence that testability is no excuse to avoid asynchronous design techniques in addition to high-performance synchronous solutions. Â© 2000 IEEE.""

The number of states in a classical HMMs is usually predefined and fixed during training", and may be quite different from the real number of hidden states of the signal source. Moreover, in pattern recognition applications, different signal sources probably have different state numbers, thereby cannot be well modeled by HMMs with a fixed state number. This paper proposes a self-adaptive design method of HMMs to overcome this limitation. According to this design, an HMM automatically matches its state number to the real state number of the signal source being modeled. To realize a practicable training algorithm for the new HMM, this paper first introduces an entropic definition of the a priori probability of the model and accordingly a maximum a posteriori (MAP) training strategy, and then designs an MAP training algorithm in the case of fixed state number based on the deterministic annealing (DA) technique. Based on this MAP training," a complete training method named shrink algorithm is finally proposed for the new HMM. Experimental results indicate that self-adaptive HMMs can model stochastic signals more accurately and have better performance in pattern recognition than classical models. Â© 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We took advantage of the improved temporal resolution of fMRI with a delayed-recognition task and identified the time-courses of the different stages of the task (encoding, memory delay, and recognition test) as predictor variables in a multiple regression analysis. Because these signals were temporally independent, individual components of tasks could be contrasted with one another, rather than entire tasks, reducing the problem of violations of pure insertion in cognitive subtraction.

To reach this goal", statistical as well as systematic CD contributions must be minimized. Here, we focus on the reduction of systematic CD variations across the masks that may be caused by process effects," e.g. dry etch loading. We address this topic by compensating such effects via design data correction analogous to proximity correction. Dry etch loading is modeled by gaussian convolution of pattern densities. Data correction is done geometrically by edge shifting. As the effect amplitude has an order of magnitude of 10 nm this can only be done on e-beam writers with small address grids to avoid big CD steps in the design data. We present modeling and correction results for special mask patterns with very strong pattern density variations showing that the compensation method is able to reduce CD uniformity by 50 - 70% depending on pattern details. The data correction itself is done with a new module developed especially to compensate long-range effects and fits nicely into the common data flow environment. For advanced photomasks the mask data preparation times have become a major issue. To tackle this fracture time increase distributed processing has been introduced into the photomask design flow. We also report first results on the fracture time reduction achievable by distributing the data correction onto a Linux cluster.""

Two novel descriptors will be examined by pattern recognition techniques such as cluster analysis, nonhierarchical K-means cluster analyses, discriminant analysis, principal coordinates analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling. The two descriptors are: (A) The ratio of polar surface area to Log P; and (B) The ratio of number of rotatable bonds to number of atoms. A group of thirteen anticancer drugs (including nitrogen mustards, busulfan, nitrosoureas) will be utilized to determine what kind of associations these two descriptors possess in comparison to more widely applied parameters of Log P, molecular volume, number of oxygens and nitrogens, polar surface area, and molecular weight. The numerical values of (A) exhibited a broad range from a negative -202.69 to as high as 8030.8; a feature for this descriptor which may allow very high resolution of drug differentiation. In contrast, the numerical values of (B) were largely fractional and less than one, which could help define fundamental and critical clinical attributes. Cluster analysis showed that descriptors (A) and (B) are significantly distinct from each other, a finding supported by principal coordinates analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, and K-means cluster analysis. Descriptor (A) is shown to be highly distinct from the remaining eight property descriptors. However, (B) is consistently shown to be closely related to Log P, number of atoms, number of rotatable bonds, and number of oxygens and nitrogens within a molecule after non-metric multidimensional scaling and principal coordinates analysis. These same pattern recognition methods showed polar surface area to be somewhat distinct from (A) and (B), and feature which may allow finer definition of drug activity due to polar surface area and important but non-distinguishable properties.

The anticancer drug Busulfan is a cell cycle non-specific alkylating agent which is utilized to maintain white blood cell counts below 15000 cells/microliter. The side effects induced by busulfan are significant and affirms the intimation for new drug constructs. Fifteen analogous compounds were generated from the molecular structure of busulfan. These compounds retain the double methanesulfonate functional groups descriptive of this class of alkylating anticancer drugs. However", the carbon chain substituent separating the methanesulfonate is highly modified in order to allow significant changes in drug properties that may produce favorable characteristics that benefit clinical application. Important properties such as Log P, polar surface area, formula weight, molecular volume, Log BB, and violations of the Rule of 5 were determined to ascertain similarities and differences. All fifteen analog compounds retained zero violations of the Rule of 5, which suggests favorable properties for useful drug availability. Values of Log BB and BB remained the same throughout at-0.841 and 0.144, respectively. In addition, values of polar surface area and number of oxygens and nitrogens remained the same throughout at 86.752 A3 and 6, respectively. However, formula weight, number of atoms, number of rotatable bonds varied significantly with Log P varying across a broad range (-0.428 to 2.734). The variance in Log P within this group of methane sulfonate compounds allows new and potentially highly beneficial pharmacological properties for clinical application. Pattern recognition techniques such as cluster analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, and K-means cluster analysis discerned underlying relationships within this group of anticancer drugs and to the parent busulfan.

Reverse engineering activities support the obtainment of abstractions and views from a target system that should help the engineers to maintain, evolve and eventually re-engineer it. Two important tasks pursued by reverse engineering are design pattern detection and software architecture reconstruction, whose main objectives are the identification of the design patterns that have been used in the implementation of a system as well as the generation of views placed at different levels of abstractions, which let the practitioners focus on the overall architecture of the system without worrying about the programming details it has been implemented with. In this context we propose an Eclipse plug-in called MARPLE (Metrics and Architecture Reconstruction Plug-in for Eclipse)," which supports both the detection of design patterns and software architecture reconstruction activities through the use of basic elements and metrics that are mechanically extracted from the source code.

This paper evaluates different design pattern recovery approaches and examines the detection accuracy of these approaches. We found that the major impedance in the accurate recovery of design patterns is the large number of variations for implementing the same pattern. Furthermore, we realized that the combination of multiple searching techniques is required to improve accuracy of pattern detection. Based on these observations, we propose variable pattern definitions, which can be customized and improved towards a pattern catalog that detects patterns in all their variations. The customizable pattern definitions are created from reusable feature types. Each feature type can use one or more searching techniques for efficient detection. The proposed approach supports detection of patterns from multiple programming languages. A prototype implementation of the approach was tested on seven different open-source software projects. For each software project, a baseline was determined and the trustworthiness of each patternâ€“project combination was rated.

Design/methodology/approach: In this work", the authors endeavor to devise a pattern recognition system based on LS-SVM which performs a multi-class categorization of three basic woven designs namely plain," twill and sateen after analyzing their features. Findings: The result establishes that LS-SVM is able to classify the fabric design with a reasonable degree of accuracy and it outperforms the standard SVM. Originality/value: The algorithmic simplicity of LS-SVM resulting from replacement of inequality constraints by equality ones and ability of handling noisy data by accommodating an error variable in its algorithm make it eminently suitable for textile pattern recognition. This paper offers a maiden application of LS-SVM in textile pattern recognition. Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.""

In other fields such a problem would be rectified using material formulations. However, the need to maintain high optoelectronic compatibility between components has hampered such development. In this paper, careful design of electronically compatible materials is demonstrated. Additive molecules that are compatible with a family of luminescent polymers are presented, and their performance in a light-emitting diode configuration is demonstrated. This formulation is aimed to adjust the glass-transition temperature, maintain/improve film-forming ability, and introduce a crosslinking functionality. It is found that, by using electronic formulations, a robust procedure is obtained that could be used to produce waveguide lasers or full-color displays. The patterning ability is shown via the construction of a single pixel that is half green and half orange. Â© 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA," Weinheim.""

The E-nose system is designed with suitable unification of adsorbent materials", microceramic heaters, metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors and pattern recognition unit. Polymers and carbon molecular sieves are used as adsorbent materials over the micro-ceramic heater to design an efficient odor filtering unit before analyte exposure to the sensor array. Sensor array response is measured for 75 different concentrations (in between 3-500 parts per million (ppm)) of five target VOCs including acetone, benzene, ethanol, pentanal," and propenoic acid. The influence of separating adsorbent material on sensor resistance is studied with objective to search the optimal material for VOCs filtering. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) results highest sensitivity while carboxen- 1021 and carboxen-1012 result the lowest sensitivity as adsorbent materials for selected target VOCs. Sensor resistance (Ra) due to adsorption of VOCs by separating adsorbent material could be extracted from the sensor resistance (Rd) due to solvent desorption from the same. Fusion of these two sensor resistances is studied for data mining with objective to get improved class identification of target VOCs. Principal component analysis (PCA) as feature extraction method in combination with support vector machine (SVM) based classification is used to design pattern recognition unit for the class recognition of VOCs. Analysis results improved clustering of target VOCs in principal component (PC) space and average class recognition rate 82.66-100% in 3-fold cross validation of SVM classifier.

While the design is particularly applied to built a pedestrian detector that uses histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features and the support vector machine (SVM) classifiers", the methodology we use is generic and can be applied to other objects, using different features and classifiers. The GPGPU paradigm is utilized for feature extraction and classification, so that the scan windows can be processed in parallel. We further propose to precompute and cache all the histograms in advance, instead of using integral images," which greatly lowers the computation cost. A multi-scale reduce strategy is employed to save expensive CPU-GPU data transfers.
