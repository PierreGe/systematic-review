In this paper, we present a novel approach to evaluating and comparing design pattern detection results. Our approach, called MoRe, introduces a novel way to present design pattern instances in a uniform fashion.

Therefore, one of the challenging issues is conformance checking of source code and design, i.e., design patterns. In addition, after developing a system, usually its documents are not maintained, so, identifying design pattern from source code can help to achieve the design of an existing system as a reverse engineering task. The variant implementations (i.e., different source codes) of a design pattern make hard to detect the design pattern instances from the source code. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a new method which aims to map the design pattern detection problem into a learning problem. The proposed design pattern detector is made by learning from the information extracted from design pattern instances which normally include variant implementations. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it on open source codes to detect six different design patterns. The experimental results show that the proposed method is promising and effective. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the principle of dynamic reactive power compensation, four control modes of STATCOM device are introduced. It is pointed out that, only the steady-state voltage control mode and transient voltage control mode are suitable for the formal operation and the pattern recognition and switchover are automatically carried out according to the voltage of target bus. The basic parameters of steady-state voltage control mode are designed and its voltage regulating range and effect on grid voltage are analyzed. The STATCOM transient voltage control logic is designed based on the specific analysis of power grid faults and it is pointed out that, the active blocking state with zero reactive power can be entered in case of near-end fault. The comparison between daily grid voltage curve and STATCOM reactive power curve confirms that, STATCOM regulates the grid voltage in real time by tracking it in the steady-state voltage control mode. The fault recording wave analysis shows that, STATCOM can send up to 90% of the designed maximum transient reactive power output in about 20 ms.

Typically, the design-process weak-points, also referred as design hotspots, are classified into patterns of fixed size. The size of the pattern defines the radius of influence for the process. These fixed sized patterns are used to search and detect process weak points in new designs without running computationally expensive process simulations. However, both the complexity of the pattern and different kinds of physical processes affect the radii of influence. Therefore, there is a need to determine the optimal pattern radius (size) for efficient hotspot detection. The methodology described here uses a combination of pattern classification and pattern search techniques to create a directed graph, referred to as the Pattern Association Tree (PAT). The pattern association tree is then filtered based on the relevance, sensitivity and context area of each pattern node. The critical patterns are identified by traversing the tree and ranking the patterns. This method has plausible applications in various areas such as process characterization, physical design verification and physical design optimization. Our initial experiments in the area of physical design verification confirm that a pattern deck with the radius optimized for each pattern is significantly more accurate at predicting design hotspots when compared to a conventional deck of fixed sized patterns. © 2015 SPIE.",,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84932154978

The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications.

Researchers focused on this problem for many years, and a variety of recognition approaches have been proposed. Though, much progress has been made, we still identify a lack of flexibility and accuracy in the pattern recognition process. This paper evaluates different design pattern recovery approaches and examines the detection accuracy of these approaches. We found that the major impedance in the accurate recovery of design patterns is the large number of variations for implementing the same pattern. Furthermore, we realized that the combination of multiple searching techniques is required to improve accuracy of pattern detection. Based on these observations, we propose variable pattern definitions, which can be customized and improved towards a pattern catalog that detects patterns in all their variations. The customizable pattern definitions are created from reusable feature types. Each feature type can use one or more searching techniques for efficient detection. The proposed approach supports detection of patterns from multiple programming languages. A prototype implementation of the approach was tested on seven different open-source software projects. For each software project, a baseline was determined and the trustworthiness of each pattern–project combination was rated. The extracted results have been compared with established baselines and with the results of previous techniques. © 2014, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.","Design motifs; Design patterns; Design recovery; Micro-structures; Pattern definitions",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84916608126

While some core code of open-source libraries may be well-documented, it is frequently the case that open-source libraries lack informative API documentation and reliable design information. As a result, the source code itself is often the sole reliable source of information for program understanding activities. In this article, we propose a reverse-engineering approach that can provide assistance during the process of understanding software through the automatic recovery of hidden design patterns in software libraries. Specifically, we use ontology formalism to represent the conceptual knowledge of the source code and semantic rules to capture the structures and behaviors of the design patterns in the libraries.

Despite their usefulness, current design pattern detection approaches have a high time complexity that hinders their application. This complexity is further aggravated with the absence of guiding principles in determining which pattern to look for first among the various patterns. To overcome this practical limit, we propose to optimize any pattern detection approach by foregoing it by a filtering phase that detects possible existence of patterns and that orders the candidate patterns in terms of their degree of resemblance to the analyzed design fragments.

Design/methodology/approach: In this work, the authors endeavor to devise a pattern recognition system based on LS-SVM which performs a multi-class categorization of three basic woven designs namely plain, twill and sateen after analyzing their features. Findings: The result establishes that LS-SVM is able to classify the fabric design with a reasonable degree of accuracy and it outperforms the standard SVM. Originality/value: The algorithmic simplicity of LS-SVM resulting from replacement of inequality constraints by equality ones and ability of handling noisy data by accommodating an error variable in its algorithm make it eminently suitable for textile pattern recognition. This paper offers a maiden application of LS-SVM in textile pattern recognition. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Features extraction; Gray level concurrence matrix; Least-square support vector machine; Pattern classification; Woven design",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896307775

Although tremendous works have been proposed to provide effective privacy protection techniques, most of the algorithms are based on post-processing that deletes, obscures or encrypts the privacy information after privacy-included raw data are recorded. Consequently, they are vulnerable to raw data leak out, which may lead to unauthorized use. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a new privacy protection scheme which is capable of excluding any privacy information at the video recording phase. In this paper, we propose an anonymous camera aiming to protect the privacy of individuals at the video capturing phase by optical masking technique. It effectively reduces the risk of raw data leakage because no privacy information will be recorded by the camera. We implemented a prototype camera, which consists of an infrared camera, a RGB camera and a liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) device. We introduce optical design and performance of the anonymous camera, the masking algorithm as well as the calibration methodology. Experimental results demonstrate that our prototype anonymous camera can perform accurate real time masking of the face for privacy protection. © 2014 IEEE.","Computational photography; Privacy protection; Surveillance camera",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919922394

Mine slope is basically formed by dynamic excavation of multi-level and multi-type, and mining benefit is the purpose of mine slope engineering when using various schemes and/or methods. Thus, the issues of design and stability analyses are the main concerns in open-pit mine slope. Based on the experiences of a variety of projects, the development process of open-pit mine slope engineering in China can be divided into four phases: (1) experience-based analogical design; (2) design in combination of limit equilibrium analysis and experience; (3) quantitative analysis design; (4) dynamic design based on comprehensive analysis. In this regard, five key technologies of the mine slope stability analysis are proposed: (1) limit equilibrium analysis; (2) numerical simulations; (3) reliability analysis; (4) ""3S"" technology; (5) equivalent pattern recognition techniques. Finally, the difficulties and challenging issues in design and stability analysis of open-pit mine in China are presented accordingly. © 2014 ejge.","Open-pit mine in china; Prospect; Research progress; Slope stability analysis",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924610159

We have implemented a set of evolutionary operators to evolve combinational circuits. Our method uses a set of examples described by their truth table, and it automatically generates a combinational logic function that represents this set. We test our system by using some examples from the literature, and also, we present a set of examples addressing more complex problems to validate the performance of our method. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Automated circuit design; Combinational logic; Evolutionary programming",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921521494
