AB  - In the present work, we describe a procedure and a prototype implementation for the automatic recognition of design patterns from documentation of software artefacts design and implementation, provided in a machine readable form, namely, the XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) coded representation of UML class diagrams. The procedure exploits a semantic representation of the patterns to be recognized, based on an existing Web Ontology Language (OWL), known as object design ontology layer (ODOL), defined by the University of Massey (New Zealand), which has been augmented with an OWL-S based representation of the patterns' dynamic behaviour. Both the UML set of diagrams related to the analysed software artefacts and the ODOL+OWL-S patterns representation are automatically scanned and translated into a first-order logic representation (namely Prolog). A set of first-order logic rules, independent from the specific pattern to be recognized, has been defined to describe the heuristics and features which trigger the recognition, exploiting the Prolog description of the patterns to be recognized and the base of Prolog facts, which represents the UML documentation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Detecting design patterns in large software systems is a common reverse engineering task that can help the comprehension process of the system's design. While several design pattern detection tools presented in the literature are capable of detecting design patterns automatically, evaluating these detection results is usually done in a manual and subjective fashion. Differences in design pattern definitions, as well as pattern instance counting and presenting, exacerbate the difficulty of evaluating design pattern detection results. In this paper, we present a novel approach to evaluating and comparing design pattern detection results. Our approach, called MoRe, introduces a novel way to present design pattern instances in a uniform fashion. Based on this characterization of design pattern instances, we propose four measures for design pattern detection evaluation that convey a concise assessment of the quality of the results produced by a given detection method. We have implemented these measures, and present case studies that showcase their usefulness. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays, software designers attempt to employ design patterns in software design phase, but design patterns may be not used in the implementation phase. Therefore, one of the challenging issues is conformance checking of source code and design, i.e., design patterns. In addition, after developing a system, usually its documents are not maintained, so, identifying design pattern from source code can help to achieve the design of an existing system as a reverse engineering task. The variant implementations (i.e., different source codes) of a design pattern make hard to detect the design pattern instances from the source code. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a new method which aims to map the design pattern detection problem into a learning problem. The proposed design pattern detector is made by learning from the information extracted from design pattern instances which normally include variant implementations. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it on open source codes to detect six different design patterns. The experimental results show that the proposed method is promising and effective. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Combined with the application practice of ±200 Mvar STATCOM in China Southern Power Grid, the strategy of power grid voltage control by large-capacity STATCOM is studied. Based on the principle of dynamic reactive power compensation, four control modes of STATCOM device are introduced. It is pointed out that, only the steady-state voltage control mode and transient voltage control mode are suitable for the formal operation and the pattern recognition and switchover are automatically carried out according to the voltage of target bus. The basic parameters of steady-state voltage control mode are designed and its voltage regulating range and effect on grid voltage are analyzed. The STATCOM transient voltage control logic is designed based on the specific analysis of power grid faults and it is pointed out that, the active blocking state with zero reactive power can be entered in case of near-end fault. The comparison between daily grid voltage curve and STATCOM reactive power curve confirms that, STATCOM regulates the grid voltage in real time by tracking it in the steady-state voltage control mode. The fault recording wave analysis shows that, STATCOM can send up to 90% of the designed maximum transient reactive power output in about 20 ms. Applications verify the proposed strategy of STATCOM power grid voltage control is feasible and effective. ©, 2015, Electric Power Automation Equipment Press. All right reserved.

AB  - A computer-aided color planning system transforming an image with natural colors into product design is addressed in this study. By using analogies to natural color patterns for the solutions in product color planning, a natural color planning system is developed. The system assists the designer to obtain optimized natural colors easily for product color planning or takes the color planning of similar products by means of designers-preferred natural colors. In terms of the product color planning design, this system converts the descriptive design processes into systematic design model by three modules: (1) natural coloring module, (2) fuzzy recognition module, and (3) image evaluation module. A case study based on applying the colors of Taiwanese butterflies to the color planning of volleyball shoes was presented to verify the feasibility of this system. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Pattern based design rule checks have emerged as an alternative to the traditional rule based design rule checks in the VLSI verification flow [1]. Typically, the design-process weak-points, also referred as design hotspots, are classified into patterns of fixed size. The size of the pattern defines the radius of influence for the process. These fixed sized patterns are used to search and detect process weak points in new designs without running computationally expensive process simulations. However, both the complexity of the pattern and different kinds of physical processes affect the radii of influence. Therefore, there is a need to determine the optimal pattern radius (size) for efficient hotspot detection. The methodology described here uses a combination of pattern classification and pattern search techniques to create a directed graph, referred to as the Pattern Association Tree (PAT). The pattern association tree is then filtered based on the relevance, sensitivity and context area of each pattern node. The critical patterns are identified by traversing the tree and ranking the patterns. This method has plausible applications in various areas such as process characterization, physical design verification and physical design optimization. Our initial experiments in the area of physical design verification confirm that a pattern deck with the radius optimized for each pattern is significantly more accurate at predicting design hotspots when compared to a conventional deck of fixed sized patterns. © 2015 SPIE.

AB  - In this paper, an approach for information systems reverse engineering is proposed and applied. The aim is to support a unified perspective to the reverse engineering process of both data and software. At the state of the art, indeed, many methods, techniques, and tools for software reverse engineering have been proposed to support program comprehension, software maintenance, and software evolution. Other approaches and tools have been proposed for data reverse engineering, with the aim, for example, to provide complete and up-to-date documentation of legacy databases. However, the two engineering communities often worked independently, and very few approaches addressed the reverse engineering of both data and software as information system's constituencies. Hence, a higher integration is needed to support a better co-evolution of databases and programs, in an environment often characterized by high availability of data and volatility of information flows. Accordingly, the approach we propose leverages the detection of object-relational mapping design patterns to build a conceptual schema of the software under analysis. Then, the conceptual schema is mapped to the domain model of the system, to support the design of the evolution of the information system itself. The approach is evaluated on two large-scale open-source enterprise applications. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Design patterns recognition and injection constitute challenging tasks in software engineering, since they are generally conducted in a non-formal way. In this paper, we will present an approach for decomposing and formalizing design patterns using graph transformation systems. We will propose a combined graph-based description for design patterns structure, interactions and constraints. Then, based on this description, we will introduce a set of Elementary Transformations whose diverse combinations lead to the design patterns injection. These elementary transformations are formal, precise and presented in a generic form that allows to describe the 23 design patterns defined by the GOF. Detailed descriptions and examples are presented in this paper in order to illustrate our approach. © 2014 SERSC.

AB  - Accurate recognition of design patterns from source code supports development-related tasks such as program comprehension, maintenance, reverse engineering, and re-engineering. Researchers focused on this problem for many years, and a variety of recognition approaches have been proposed. Though, much progress has been made, we still identify a lack of flexibility and accuracy in the pattern recognition process. This paper evaluates different design pattern recovery approaches and examines the detection accuracy of these approaches. We found that the major impedance in the accurate recovery of design patterns is the large number of variations for implementing the same pattern. Furthermore, we realized that the combination of multiple searching techniques is required to improve accuracy of pattern detection. Based on these observations, we propose variable pattern definitions, which can be customized and improved towards a pattern catalog that detects patterns in all their variations. The customizable pattern definitions are created from reusable feature types. Each feature type can use one or more searching techniques for efficient detection. The proposed approach supports detection of patterns from multiple programming languages. A prototype implementation of the approach was tested on seven different open-source software projects. For each software project, a baseline was determined and the trustworthiness of each pattern–project combination was rated. The extracted results have been compared with established baselines and with the results of previous techniques. © 2014, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.

AB  - The UML class diagram is used to show the structure of a particular system so that the designer can see the overview picture of the system. The design patterns help us solve the anticipated problems of the system design in the software process. It also helps guide the system design to be more flexible and scalable. However, the automatic detection of design patterns is useful as well in order to assess the expected patterns found in the design model. This paper proposes a tool for detecting design pattern in class diagram using ontologies. Our approach exploits the SQWRL rule created in the ontology to reason the structure of each particular design pattern. The number of target design pattern is reported and the related components of the pattern are located correctly. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The process of understanding and reusing software is often time-consuming, especially in legacy code and open-source libraries. While some core code of open-source libraries may be well-documented, it is frequently the case that open-source libraries lack informative API documentation and reliable design information. As a result, the source code itself is often the sole reliable source of information for program understanding activities. In this article, we propose a reverse-engineering approach that can provide assistance during the process of understanding software through the automatic recovery of hidden design patterns in software libraries. Specifically, we use ontology formalism to represent the conceptual knowledge of the source code and semantic rules to capture the structures and behaviors of the design patterns in the libraries. Several software libraries were examined with this approach and the evaluation results show that effective and flexible detection of design patterns can be achieved without using hard-coded heuristics. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Design patterns represent high-level recurring abstractions that reflect the know-how of experts. Their detection is a key task in the context of software engineering; it is very useful in program comprehension, design recovery and also for re-documenting object-oriented systems. Despite their usefulness, current design pattern detection approaches have a high time complexity that hinders their application. This complexity is further aggravated with the absence of guiding principles in determining which pattern to look for first among the various patterns. To overcome this practical limit, we propose to optimize any pattern detection approach by foregoing it by a filtering phase that detects possible existence of patterns and that orders the candidate patterns in terms of their degree of resemblance to the analyzed design fragments. The herein proposed filtering approach exploits semantic and structural design metrics to look for the semantic and structural symptoms of design pattern instances. Its performance is experimentally demonstrated through our design pattern detection method MAPeD (Multi-phase Approach for Pattern Discovery) applied on the open source system JUnit. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to give an approach for categorization of diverse textile designs using their textural features as extracted from their gray images by means of multi-class least-square support vector machines (LS-SVM). Design/methodology/approach: In this work, the authors endeavor to devise a pattern recognition system based on LS-SVM which performs a multi-class categorization of three basic woven designs namely plain, twill and sateen after analyzing their features. Findings: The result establishes that LS-SVM is able to classify the fabric design with a reasonable degree of accuracy and it outperforms the standard SVM. Originality/value: The algorithmic simplicity of LS-SVM resulting from replacement of inequality constraints by equality ones and ability of handling noisy data by accommodating an error variable in its algorithm make it eminently suitable for textile pattern recognition. This paper offers a maiden application of LS-SVM in textile pattern recognition. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Privacy protection in the surveillance video data has received great attention. Although tremendous works have been proposed to provide effective privacy protection techniques, most of the algorithms are based on post-processing that deletes, obscures or encrypts the privacy information after privacy-included raw data are recorded. Consequently, they are vulnerable to raw data leak out, which may lead to unauthorized use. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a new privacy protection scheme which is capable of excluding any privacy information at the video recording phase. In this paper, we propose an anonymous camera aiming to protect the privacy of individuals at the video capturing phase by optical masking technique. It effectively reduces the risk of raw data leakage because no privacy information will be recorded by the camera. We implemented a prototype camera, which consists of an infrared camera, a RGB camera and a liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) device. We introduce optical design and performance of the anonymous camera, the masking algorithm as well as the calibration methodology. Experimental results demonstrate that our prototype anonymous camera can perform accurate real time masking of the face for privacy protection. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Based on current researches and developments of open-pit mine slope in China, the engineering features of open-pit mine slopes are summarized. Mine slope is basically formed by dynamic excavation of multi-level and multi-type, and mining benefit is the purpose of mine slope engineering when using various schemes and/or methods. Thus, the issues of design and stability analyses are the main concerns in open-pit mine slope. Based on the experiences of a variety of projects, the development process of open-pit mine slope engineering in China can be divided into four phases: (1) experience-based analogical design; (2) design in combination of limit equilibrium analysis and experience; (3) quantitative analysis design; (4) dynamic design based on comprehensive analysis. In this regard, five key technologies of the mine slope stability analysis are proposed: (1) limit equilibrium analysis; (2) numerical simulations; (3) reliability analysis; (4) "3S" technology; (5) equivalent pattern recognition techniques. Finally, the difficulties and challenging issues in design and stability analysis of open-pit mine in China are presented accordingly. © 2014 ejge.

AB  - Enormous advances have been made in the recent years in regard to the mechanisms and neural circuits by which odors are sensed and perceived. Part of this understanding has been gained from parallel studies in insects and rodents that show striking similarity in the mechanisms they use to sense, encode, and perceive odors. In this review, we provide a short introduction to the functioning of olfactory systems from transduction of odorant stimuli into electrical signals in sensory neurons to the anatomical and functional organization of the networks involved in neural representation of odors in the central nervous system. We make emphasis on the functional and anatomical architecture of the first synaptic relay of the olfactory circuit, the olfactory bulb in vertebrates and the antennal lobe in insects. We discuss how the exquisite and conserved architecture of this structure is established and how different odors are encoded in mosaic activity patterns. Finally, we discuss the validity of methods used to compare activation patterns in relation to perceptual similarity. © 2014 International Society for Neurochemistry.

AB  - Several ensemble-based techniques have been proposed to design pattern recognition systems when data has imbalanced class distributions, although class proportions may change over time according to the operational environment. For instance, in video surveillance applications, face recognition (FR) is employed to detect the presence of target individuals of interest in potentially complex and changing environments. Systems for FR in video surveillance are typically designed a priori with a limited amount of reference target data and prior knowledge of underlying class distributions. However, the relatively proportion of target and non-target faces captured during operations varies over time. Estimating the actual proportion of data from the input data stream could allow to dynamically adapt ensembles to reflect operational conditions. In this paper, the selection and fusion of ensembles produced through Boolean Combination (BC) of classifiers is periodically adapted based on the class proportions estimated from input streams. BC techniques have been shown to efficiently integrate the responses of multiple diversified classifiers in the ROC space, yet the impact on performance of imbalanced data distributions is difficult to observe from ROC curves. Given a diversified pool of classifiers and a desired false positive rate (fpr), the new Skew-Sensitive Boolean Combination (SSBC) technique exploits the Precision-Recall Operating Characteristic (PROC) space, leading to a higher level of performance. A set of BCs of base classifiers is initially produced with imbalanced reference data in the PROC space, where each BC curve corresponds to different level of imbalance (a growing number of non-target samples versus a fixed number of target ones). Then, during operations, the closest adjacent levels of class imbalance are periodically estimated using the Hellinger distance between the data distribution of inputs and that of imbalance levels, and used to approximate the most accurate BC of classifiers from operational points of these curves. Simulation results on Faces In Action video surveillance data indicate that ensemble-based FR systems using the SSBC technique outperform the same systems using traditional BC techniques with Random Under-Sampling and One-Sided Selection. It allows to dynamically select BCs that provide a higher level of precision (and F1 value) for target individuals, and a significantly smaller difference between desired and actual fpr. Performance of this adaptive approach is also comparable to the costly full recalculation of BCs (as required by a BC technique to accommodate a specific level of imbalance), but for a computational complexity that is considerably lower. Finally, SSBC is shown to achieve a high level of discrimination between target and non-target individuals when face tracking is exploited to accumulate ensemble predictions for facial captures that correspond to a same person in the video scene. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective of present study is to design an efficient odor sensor array based artificial electronic nose (E-nose) system for the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in medical and biometric applications. The E-nose system is designed with suitable unification of adsorbent materials, microceramic heaters, metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors and pattern recognition unit. Polymers and carbon molecular sieves are used as adsorbent materials over the micro-ceramic heater to design an efficient odor filtering unit before analyte exposure to the sensor array. Sensor array response is measured for 75 different concentrations (in between 3-500 parts per million (ppm)) of five target VOCs including acetone, benzene, ethanol, pentanal, and propenoic acid. The influence of separating adsorbent material on sensor resistance is studied with objective to search the optimal material for VOCs filtering. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) results highest sensitivity while carboxen- 1021 and carboxen-1012 result the lowest sensitivity as adsorbent materials for selected target VOCs. Sensor resistance (Ra) due to adsorption of VOCs by separating adsorbent material could be extracted from the sensor resistance (Rd) due to solvent desorption from the same. Fusion of these two sensor resistances is studied for data mining with objective to get improved class identification of target VOCs. Principal component analysis (PCA) as feature extraction method in combination with support vector machine (SVM) based classification is used to design pattern recognition unit for the class recognition of VOCs. Analysis results improved clustering of target VOCs in principal component (PC) space and average class recognition rate 82.66-100% in 3-fold cross validation of SVM classifier.

AB  - Software design patterns are abstract descriptions of best practice solutions for recurring design problems. The information about which design pattern is implemented where in a software design is very helpful and important for software maintenance and evolution. This information is usually lost due to poor, obsolete or lack of documentation, which raises the importance of automatic recognition techniques. However, their vague and abstract nature allows them to be implemented in various ways, which gives them resistance to be automatically and accurately recognized. This paper presents the first recognition approach to be solely based on machine learning methods. We build a training dataset by using several existing recognition tools and we use feature selection methods to select the input feature vectors. Artificial neural networks are then trained to perform the whole recognition process. Our approach is evaluated by conducting an experiment to recognize six design patterns in an open source application. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Detecting design pattern instances from source codes can assist the understanding of the systems. This paper presents an approach to the detection of design patterns based on graph isomorphism. We introduce two kinds of graphs, among which one represents the system design and the other describes the design patterns to be recovered. In order to detect instances of design patterns, we first identify in system graph all the candidate classes that correspond to the pattern classes. Afterwards we select some of candidate classes to form the sub-graphs of system graph, which are then checked isomorphic to the pattern graph or not. Those isomorphic sub-graphs are regarded to be corresponding to instances of the design patterns. The detection of decorator pattern is given as the example to show the effectiveness of the approach. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Here we describe a procedure and a prototype implementation for the automatic recognition of Design Patterns from documentation of Software Artefacts' design and implementation, provided in a machine readable form, namely the XMI coded representation of UML diagrams. The procedure exploits a semantic representation of the patterns to be recognized, based on the ODOL ontology defined by the University of Massey (New Zealand) [12], which we have augmented with an OWL-S based representation of the patterns' dynamic behaviour. Both the UML set of diagrams related to the analysed Software Artefacts and the ODOL+OWL-S patterns' representation are automatically scanned and translated into a first order logic representation (namely Prolog). A set of first order logic rules, independent from the specific pattern to be recognized, have been defined to describe the heuristics and features which trigger the recognition, exploiting the Prolog description of the patterns to be recognized and the base of Prolog facts which represents the UML documentation. © 2013 ACM.

AB  - Software design patterns describe recurring design problems and provide the essence of best practice solutions. It is useful and important, for various software engineering tasks, to know which design pattern is implemented where in a software design. However, this information is often lost due to poor or absent documentation, and so accurate recognition tools are required. The problem is that design patterns, given their abstract and vague nature, have a level of resistance to be automatically and accurately recognized. Although this vagueness or fuzziness can be captured and modelled by the fuzzy inference system, it has not yet been applied to solve this problem. This paper fills this gap by proposing an approach for design pattern recognition based on Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System. Our approach consists of two phases: space reduction phase and design pattern recognition phase. Both phases are implemented by ANFIS. We evaluate the approach by an experiment conducted to recognize six design patterns in an open source application. The results show that the approach is viable and promising. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper an approach to automatically detect Design Patterns (DPs) in Object Oriented systems is presented. It allows to link system's source code components to the roles they play in each pattern. DPs are modelled by high level structural properties (e.g. inheritance, dependency, invocation, delegation, type nesting and membership relationships) that are checked against the system structure and components. The proposed metamodel also allows to define DP variants, overriding the structural properties of existing DP models, to improve detection quality. The approach was validated on an open benchmark containing several open-source systems of increasing sizes. Moreover, for other two systems, the results have been compared with the ones from a similar approach existing in literature. The results obtained on the analyzed systems, the identified variants and the efficency and effectiveness of the approach are thoroughly presented and discussed. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Structural design patterns address concerns related to high-level structures for applications being developed. Accurately recovered instances of structural design patterns support development related tasks like program comprehension and reengineering. However, the detection of structural design pattern instances is not always a straightforward task. The lack of documentation, the ad-hoc nature of programming and the possible variants of pattern instances often lead to the low accuracy of detection. In this paper, we present an approach to the detection of instances of structural design patterns using source codes. We first transform the source codes and predefined patterns into graphs, with the classes as nodes and the relations as edges. We then identify the instances of sub-patterns that would be the possible constituents of pattern instances by means of subgraph discovery. The sub-pattern instances are further merged by joint classes to see if the collective matches one of the predefined patterns. Compared with existing approaches, our approach focuses on simple sub-patterns, not complicated patterns. In this way, it can not only simplify the detection process, but also detect multiple pattern instances at a time. The results of the experiments on detecting pattern instances of Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator and Proxy from 4 open source software systems demonstrate that our approach obtains better precision than the existing approaches. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Software design patterns are solutions to recurring problems. These solutions have been widely accepted and adopted by the software practitioners. Design Patterns were initially described informally through the use of textual descriptions or some object oriented graphical notations. However, informal descriptions of design patterns give rise to ambiguity and incorrect usage of the design pattern. Many design pattern specification languages have been proposed to address the shortcomings of informal descriptions. These design pattern formalization techniques have been developed for different intentions including verification of design patterns and detection of design patterns in source code. In this paper we provide a set of evaluation criteria to evaluate and compare the various design pattern specification languages in order to aid practitioners and researchers to select the appropriate language for their use. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In engineering design courses, many problems have a specification that the student's implementation must meet, but give the student a large range of freedom for the internal design of that implementation. There may be several distinct, correct strategies for solving them, some of which may be unknown to the teaching staff or intelligent tutor designer. When a student is pursuing an unrecognized strategy and begins to struggle, staff may redirect them, costing unnecessary work, and automated hint generators may offer unhelpful feedback. We have taken a first step toward discovering these alternate correct strategies by visualizing many student solutions together, using dynamic and static features of these solutions, so that the teaching staff can understand the space of correct strategies. This approach has been applied to two domains: an online Matlab programming challenge and an undergraduate computer architecture course. We discuss these initial investigations and pose discussion questions to the community about potential enhancement and application of this analysis. Copyright © 2013 ACM.

AB  - In engineering design courses, many problems have a specification that the student's implementation must meet, but give the student a broad range of freedom for the internal design of that implementation. There may be several distinct, correct strategies for solving them, some of which may be unknown to the teaching staff or intelligent tutor designer. Visualizing and classifying the multiple solutions that students generate in response to assigned engineering design problems will improve hints and answers to students' questions, whether they are provided by peers, staff, or automation. I log incremental snapshots of students' solutions as they progress toward correct and incorrect solutions. Initial investigations demonstrate that the choice of features to represent solutions is critical, and may be domain- or problem-dependent. Copyright © 2013 ACM.

AB  - Reconstruction of 3D building objects from 2D drawings is a vital approach for 3D model reconstructing, and the key is symbol recognition of the architectural construction components in 2D graphics. Existing algorithms of graphics symbol recognition are lack of robustness, scalability and with low recognition ability to deal with graphics transformation. This study constructed Attributed Graph to express the geometrical characteristics, topological relationships and semantic characteristics of architectural drawing symbols uniformly. The recognition approach with Attributed Graph can expand easily and flexibly to deal with rotation transformation and scaling transformation. Considering the semantic mapping from drawings to models systematically, created corresponding mapping mechanism to guarantee robustness of model creating system. Achieve internal and external integration of three-dimensional architectural models automatically, by using 3Dmax modeling script. Import models to GeoDatabase, so as to using the model in 3DGIS application. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - Objective. This study investigates the effect of the involuntary motor activity of paretic-spastic muscles on the classification of surface electromyography (EMG) signals. Approach. Two data collection sessions were designed for 8 stroke subjects to voluntarily perform 11 functional movements using their affected forearm and hand at relatively slow and fast speeds. For each stroke subject, the degree of involuntary motor activity present in the voluntary surface EMG recordings was qualitatively described from such slow and fast experimental protocols. Myoelectric pattern recognition analysis was performed using different combinations of voluntary surface EMG data recorded from the slow and fast sessions. Main results. Across all tested stroke subjects, our results revealed that when involuntary surface EMG is absent or present in both the training and testing datasets, high accuracies (>96%, >98%, respectively, averaged over all the subjects) can be achieved in the classification of different movements using surface EMG signals from paretic muscles. When involuntary surface EMG was solely involved in either the training or testing datasets, the classification accuracies were dramatically reduced (<89%, <85%, respectively). However, if both the training and testing datasets contained EMG signals with the presence and absence of involuntary EMG interference, high accuracies were still achieved (>97%). Significance. The findings of this study can be used to guide the appropriate design and implementation of myoelectric pattern recognition based systems or devices toward promoting robot-aided therapy for stroke rehabilitation. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced java developers. Design patterns abstract reusable object-oriented software designs which are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. Each pattern solves design problems that occur in every day development. The detection of design patterns during the process of software reverse engineering can provide a better understanding of the software system. The most recent approaches in design pattern detection rely on the abstract syntax tree representation of the source code for fact extraction. This paper proposes a new way to detect design pattern in Java applications by analyzing the java source code. This paper discussed about the relations both between classes and objects and established the derivative design pattern about model property. Using the roles, responsibilities and collaboration information of each design pattern define static definitions. The static definitions are used to find candidate instances during the static analysis by using BCEL. After the static analysis the found candidate instances are validated by using the dynamic behavior of design patterns. We instrument the Java byte code of the application we are analyzing with additional code fragments and extract method traces from the running application. These method traces represent the dynamic facts of an application. The several restrictions are presented to define design patterns dynamically. Four common patterns of original GoF design patterns are tested and the results are analyzed which give better results in detecting design patterns comparing with other tools. In addition a Java source code static checking tool, an Eclipse plug-in, is implemented. Finally several java applications source codes were analyzed by using the plug-in, and verified the feasibility of the approach. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Design patterns play a significant role in reverse engineering by providing information not only on how but also on why a solution has been implemented in a specific way because of their semantics. The application of design patterns leads to their personalization to a specific context, hence to the generation of variants. This makes their recognition a challenging task, which may be addressed through the understanding and detection of the micro-structures design patterns are made of. This is very useful for the detection as well as for the application of design patterns. The principal aim of this paper is to present a survey on these micro-structures and a comparison among them in the perspective of reverse engineering. Because of their less complex structure and behavior, as well as closer link to the source code, the recognition of these micro-structures may be automated, which can be considered a step towards the automatic recognition of the more complex design patterns. In this paper, we consider four of the most significant types of micro-structures: elemental design patterns, clues, sub-patterns, and micro patterns. To analyze the role of the micro-structures in the design pattern detection process, we make a comparison among these four types of micro-structures and among the micro-structures of various types in order to identify the relations among them.

AB  - The ability to formulate and apply principles are crucial 21st Century skills. These skills are inherent in Mathematical thinking processes, which require learners to search for abstract problem-solving methods that would serve as analogy-enhancing bridges enabling transfer between different task situations. Consequently, two component skills that need to be mastered are pattern recognition and reasoning. In this exploratory study, we adopted an inquiry-based approach to design technological scaffolds. Wre aimed to investigate the relation between the teacher's beliefs, his design of instructional practices, the design of technology and students' learning outcomes. We discovered that epistemic agency can be used as the core design factor, redefining earlier definitions of context. Furthermore, teachers' beliefs clearly influenced how he sequenced the classroom curriculum, how he relates Mathematical problems with real life, how he identifies, interprets and addresses students' misconceptions (especially with regards to the lower-performing students) and how students should be motivated to learn. From the students' perspective, based on the Technology Acceptance Model, the highest score was for satisfaction when using the system, followed by usefulness (i.e., the system helped them to reason and think), ease of use and opportunities to practice. We inferred from this high score that students liked being challenged by diverse problems of increasing difficulty. comparisons between their pattern recognition and fill in the blanks answers eshowed that our system was able to identify implicitly how students actually think, areas students need further help with and most importantly, may be able to utilize students's thinking strategies to implicitly predict student performance in Mathematics. Based on these findings, we suggest implications to teacher professional development/TPACK.

AB  - As motion sensors have become more advanced, gesture-control systems have become more popular in gaming and everyday appliances. However, in existing systems, gestures are predefined by designers or pattern-recognition experts. Such predefined gestures can be inconvenient for specific users in specific environments. Hence, it would be useful to provide end users the flexibility to design and customize gestures to satisfy their own needs. In this paper, we present a system that allows end users to design and customize gestures interactively. A key challenge is that arbitrary user-defined gestures can be difficult for the computer to recognize reliably. A gesture may be too similar to frequent unintentional moves, too difficult to distinguish from other gestures, and/or too difficult to perform consistently. Hence, our system first evaluates the userdefined gesture and then gives feedback on its appropriateness to guide the user in the design of appropriate gestures. A user study demonstrated that users were able to design more appropriate gestures with such guidance than without it. © The Authors.

AB  - Background: Modafinil, a putative cognitive enhancing drug, has previously been shown to improve performance of healthy volunteers as well as patients with attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia, mainly in tests of executive functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of modafinil on non-verbal cognitive functions in healthy volunteers, with a particular focus on variations of cognitive load, measures of motivational factors and the effects on creative problem-solving. Methods: A double-blind placebo-controlled parallel design study evaluated the effect of 200 mg of modafinil (N = 32) or placebo (N = 32) in non-sleep deprived healthy volunteers. Non-verbal tests of divergent and convergent thinking were used to measure creativity. A new measure of task motivation was used, together with more levels of difficulty on neuropsychological tests from the CANTAB battery. Results: Improvements under modafinil were seen on spatial working memory, planning and decision making at the most difficult levels, as well as visual pattern recognition memory following delay. Subjective ratings of enjoyment of task performance were significantly greater under modafinil compared with placebo, but mood ratings overall were not affected. The effects of modafinil on creativity were inconsistent and did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Modafinil reliably enhanced task enjoyment and performance on several cognitive tests of planning and working memory, but did not improve paired associates learning. The findings confirm that modafinil can enhance aspects of highly demanding cognitive performance in non-sleep deprived individuals.

AB  - One of the main ideas of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is the delivery of flexibly composable services provided on world-wide markets. For a successful service discovery, service requests have to be matched with the available service offers. However, in a situation in which no service that completely matches the request can be discovered, the customer may tolerate slight discrepancies between request and offer. Some existing fuzzy matching approaches are able to detect such service variants, but they do not allow to explicitly specify which parts of a request are not mandatory. In this paper, we improve an existing service matching approach based on Visual Contracts leveraging our preliminary work of design pattern detection. Thereby, we support explicit specifications of service variants and realize gradual matching results that can be ranked in order to discover the service offer that matches a customer's request best. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Software design patterns reflect best practice solutions applied to frequent design problems. In the literature, various approaches have been proposed to detect the occurrences of design patterns. Prolog rules and similar formalisms have already been utilized for reasoning about the structural and behavioral properties of the software design. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer some weaknesses that we aim to reveal and discuss. In this paper, we discuss Prolog based approaches to detect the design patterns in software. In addition, we evaluate the capability of Prolog rules and highlight the strengths and weaknesses. Copyright © 2013 by Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

AB  - Design patterns have been used successfully to build well-organized, flexible software systems. In the reverse engineering field, detecting design patterns can simplify program comprehension by providing clues about the rationale behind the system's design. However, the precision and recall of existing approaches to design pattern detection leave room for improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique called FiG that complements existing detection methods by utilizing finegrained static information contained in the software system. Our approach filters a large number of false positives by utilizing fine-grained rules that describe the static structure of a design pattern. We have implemented our approach in the context of the Eiffel programming language. Several experiments were performed to determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The intelligent monitoring refers to the use of pattern recognition technology, digital signal processing, artificial intelligence theory and automatic control technology, and integrating video surveillance into the monitoring system, to enable the system become intelligent. The core technology for the system is the identification and matching of moving targets; and the fast & exact match detection of a moving target is the key step and technical basis for subsequent identification. Image-based matching has a wide range of applications in the field of industrial product testing, identification of aerial targets, the identification of ground targets. In this paper, I'd discuss over the program of utilizing 1K50 + LPC2106 processor to achieve the target detection, together with the specific algorithm.

AB  - Pattern is one of the most simple and powerful techniques to improve the design, and consequently enhance the maintainability, reusability, and reverse engineering. Design pattern detection is a useful technique for gaining knowledge on the design issues of existing systems and improves the system's comprehension, which consequently enhance the software maintainability and evolution. Numerous studies have been conducted and many tools have been developed to detect design patterns, whereas only few studies considered the antipattern, which has not been investigated with the same extent of patterns detection. This study presents the antipatterns of object oriented design, their definitions, detecting approaches and issues related to their detection. That provides a clear state of the antipatterns detection and its issues that need to be addressed in the future. The result indicates that the antipatterns detection requires further investigation for several limitations and issues. © 2012 AICIT.

AB  - Design patterns provide experience reusability and increase quality of object oriented designs. Knowing which design patterns are implemented in a software is important in comprehending, maintaining and refactoring its design. However, despite the interest in using design patterns, traditionally, their usage is not explicitly documented. Therefore, a method is required to reveal this information from some artifacts of the systems (e.g. source codes, models, and executables). In this paper, an approach is proposed which uses the Semantic Web technologies for automatically detecting design patterns from Java source code. It is based on the semantic data model as the internal representation, and on SPARQL query execution as the analysis mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that this approach is both feasible and effective, and it reduces the complexity of detecting design patterns to creating a set of SPARQL queries. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Semi-supervised classification from pairwise constraints is a challenge in pattern recognition, since the constraints just represent the relationships between data pairs rather than the definite labels. In the last few years, several methods have been proposed, however, they still utilize either the discriminability within the constraints or the abundant unlabeled data insufficiently. In this paper, we present a novel discriminative indefinite kernel classifier. We first transform the constrained data pairs into newly-labeled samples by an outer product transformation, and then introduce an indefinite discriminative regularizer in the transformed space in order to further embed the discriminative and structural information involved in the newly labeled and unlabeled samples into the classifier design. We validate that such classifier naturally lies in the more general Reproducing Kernel Krein Space rather than the common Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Experiments show the superiority of our method. © 2012 ICPR Org Committee.

AB  - Wavefront coding paradigm can be used not only for compensation of aberrations and depth-of-field improvement but also for an optical encryption. An optical convolution of the image with the PSF occurs when a diffractive optical element (DOE) with a known point spread function (PSF) is placed in the optical path. In this case, an optically encoded image is registered instead of the true image. Decoding of the registered image can be performed using standard digital deconvolution methods. In such class of optical-digital systems, the PSF of the DOE is used as an encryption key. Therefore, a reliability and cryptographic resistance of such an encryption method depends on the size and complexity of the PSF used for optical encoding. This paper gives a preliminary analysis on reliability and possible vulnerabilities of such an encryption method. Experimental results on brute-force attack on the optically encrypted images are presented. Reliability estimation of optical coding based on wavefront coding paradigm is evaluated. An analysis of possible vulnerabilities is provided. © 2012 SPIE.

AB  - A novel experimental setup using accelerometer and gyroscope sensors embedded on a single board along with a distance-based pattern recognition algorithm is presented for accurately identifying basic movements for possible application in gaming using a mobile platform. As an example, we considered some basic step sequences in the popular dance game (e.g., dance dance revolution), and could detect these movements with a reasonably high probability. We envision that the experimental results presented in this paper will motivate future research in the world of mobile gaming applications using advanced smart phones with a dual module design. It is remarked that the same technology may be used to help the elderly stay at home. This technology can be applied to track and monitor the movements of elderly people to guarantee they are getting up, to detect falls, or to monitor electric wheel chairs so that they may go outside alone thereby assisting the elderly while they live independently in their own homes where they feel safe. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The paper presents an approach for design patterns recognition in legacy code by the combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques. The implement process has three steps: static parser, SWRL rules and dynamic validation. The static parser translates the input source code into the AST. The protéǵ tool defines programming concepts with ontology model and design pattern into SWRL rules, and these SWRL rules are defined in OWL format, and then the code instances are constructed as OWL individuals and map to the individuals of the program ontology model. Finally, subsequent dynamic analysis is employed to confirm or weaken the results from static analysis. We discuss our approach for the Observer design pattern on a Java system. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - This paper chronicles one researcher's journey at the National Institute of Mental Health, exploring ways to understand the neural systems responsible for the cognitive sub-processes of working memory tasks. Both the opportunities and the pitfalls with applying the idea of cognitive subtraction to neuroimaging data were well-known from studies using positron emission tomography. We took advantage of the improved temporal resolution of fMRI with a delayed-recognition task and identified the time-courses of the different stages of the task (encoding, memory delay, and recognition test) as predictor variables in a multiple regression analysis. Because these signals were temporally independent, individual components of tasks could be contrasted with one another, rather than entire tasks, reducing the problem of violations of pure insertion in cognitive subtraction. This approach enabled us to draw more detailed conclusions about the neural systems of higher cognition and the organization of prefrontal cortex than had been possible before fMRI. Further enhancements and innovations over the last 20. years by a multitude of researchers across the field have greatly expanded this knowledge, but this approach called "orthogonal task design" has remained a fundamental component of many of these modern studies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The ambiguity function (AF) as an important tool for time-frequency analysis, has widely been used in radar signal processing, sonar technology and so on. It does well in analysing chirp signals. However, it fails in estimating the cubic phase (CP) signal, which is required in many applications. As the generalisation of the Fourier transform (FT), the linear canonical transform (LCT) has received much attention, and has found many applications in filter design, pattern recognition, optics and so on. In this study, the authors define a new kind of AF - the AF based on the LCT (LCTAF), which is proposed to estimate the CP signal. Some important properties of LCTAF are discussed, such as symmetry and conjugation property, shifting property and Moyal formula. The relationships between the LCTAF and other time-frequency analysis distributions are derived, including the classical AF, the Wigner distribution function (WDF) based on LCT, the short-FT and the wavelet transform. The linear canonical AF (LCAF) is another kind of AF. The authors also discuss its relation with AF and WDF and give some new properties of the LCAF. At last, the LCTAF is applied for estimating the CP signal. The simulation indicates that the LCTAF is useful and effective. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - Design patterns are good design solutions to recurring problems. Many works were interested in design patterns identification either for reverse engineering purposes, or for design improvement purposes. All existing approaches considered that a pattern is detected through both its structure and behavior, but no one considers the semantic aspect conveyed by the class and method names. In this paper, we propose a technique that exploits the semantic aspect to identify occurrences of a pattern in a design. In addition to the structural and behavioral analyses, the semantic analysis is very useful, specifically when there is a doubt between two design patterns having similar structures. By resolving a non deterministic identification, the identification precision increases. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Two-level supersaturated designs are very useful in the screening experiments and the common goal is to identify sparse but dominant active factors with low cost. Recently, a new analysis procedure called the Stepwise Response Refinement Screener (SRRS) method is proposed to screen important effects. This paper extends this method to the two-level nonregular fractional factorial designs. The applications to several real-life examples suggest that the SRRS method is able to retrieve similar results as the existing methods do. Simulation studies show that compared to existing methods in the literature, the SRRS method performs well in terms of the true model identification rate and the average model size.

AB  - Many activities can be done to support software evolution and reverse engineering of a system. Design pattern detection is one of these activities. It is useful to gain knowledge on the design issues of an existing system, on its architecture and design quality, improving the comprehension of the system and hence its maintainability and evolution. Several tools for design pattern detection have been developed in the literature, but they usually provide different results when analyzing the same systems. Some works have been proposed in the literature to compare these results, but a standard and widely-accepted benchmark is not yet available. In this work we propose our benchmark web application for design pattern detection, based on a community driven evaluation. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Automated design pattern detection (DPD) is a challenging reengineering task. The detection quality (precision and recall) of DPD tools has so far been insufficient to make DPD integral part of current IDEs and development practices. In this paper, we present a novel approach and a related tool, DPJF. For all implemented pattern detectors and all projects used for evaluation, DPJF achieves 100% precision and the best recall of all evaluated tools. Still, its analysis speed competes with the fastest existing tools. The high detection quality is achieved by a well-balanced combination of structural and behavioural analysis techniques whereas the good performance is achieved by emprically validated simplifications of the individual techniques. Our results lay the basis for routine application of DPD in program comprehension and let DPJF pioneer novel uses of DPD for software quality assesment and improvement. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - This article deals with performance verification of architecture models of real-time embedded systems. Although real-time scheduling theory provides numerous analytical methods called feasibility tests for scheduling analysis, their use is a complicated task. In order to assist an architecture model designer in early verification, we provide an approach, based on real-time specific design patterns, enabling an automatic schedulability analysis. This analysis is based on existing feasibility tests, whose selection is deduced from the compliance of the system to a design pattern and other system's properties. Those conformity verifications are integrated into a schedulability tool called Cheddar. We show how to model the relationships between design patterns and feasibility tests and design patterns themselves. Based on these models, we apply a model-based engineering process to generate, in Ada, a feasibility test selection tool. The tool is able to detect from an architecture model which are the feasibility tests that the designer can apply. We explain a method for a designer willing to use this approach. We also describe the design patterns defined and the selection algorithm. © 2011 ACM.

AB  - Accurately recovered design patterns support development related tasks like program comprehension and reengineering. Researchers proposed a variety of recognition approaches already. Though, much progress was made, there is still a lack of accuracy and flexibility in recognition. A major problem is the large variety of variants for implementing the same pattern. Furthermore, the integration of multiple search techniques is required to provide more accurate and effective pattern detection. In this paper, we propose variable pattern definitions composed of reusable feature types. Each feature type is assigned to one of multiple search techniques that is best fitting for its detection. A prototype implementation was applied to three open source applications. For each system a baseline was determined and used for comparison with the results of previous techniques. We reached very good results with an improved pattern catalog, but also demonstrated the necessity for customizations on new inspected systems. These results demonstrate the importance of customizable pattern definitions and multiple search techniques in order to overcome accuracy and flexibility issues of previous approaches. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The understandability, maintainability, and reusability of object-oriented programs could be improved by automatically detecting well-known design patterns in programs. Many existing detection techniques are based on static analysis and use strict conditions composed of class structure data. Hence, it is difficult for them to detect design patterns in which the class structures are similar. Moreover, it is difficult for them to deal with diversity in design pattern applications. We propose a design pattern detection technique using metrics and machine learning. Our technique judges candidates for the roles that compose the design patterns by using machine learning and measurements of metrics, and it detects design patterns by analyzing the relations between candidates. It suppresses false negatives and distinguishes patterns in which the class structures are similar. We conducted experiments that showed that our technique was more accurate than two previous techniques.

AB  - Design Pattern Detection is a part of many solutions to Software Engineering problems. It is a part of reengineering process and thus gives significant information to the designer. Design Pattern improves the program understanding and software maintenance. Therefore, a reliable design pattern discovery is required. Graph theoretic approaches have been used for design pattern detection in past. Here we are applying state space representation of graph matching algorithm for design pattern detection. State space representation easily describes the graph matching process. Using our approach variants of each design pattern as well as any occurrence of a design pattern can be detected. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

AB  - One important issue concerning design patterns in reverse engineering is their detection to support program comprehension, design recovery, system (re-)documentation, and software evolution. The objectives of this paper are to identify and analyze different types of building blocks of design patterns and to evaluate if the detection of these building blocks (called micro-structures) is relevant for the detection of occurrences of the design patterns. This analysis is useful to understand how the different types of micro-structures can be combined to better comprehend design patterns and to improve their detection. To achieve the objectives, the paper provides a description of different micro-structures, an analysis of their relevance in different design motifs, and a statistical analysis on the number and types of micro-structures present in different design patterns. Finally, we investigate if the detection of some design patterns can be performed only through the detection of a combined set of micro-structures, or other techniques should be exploited. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper a new class of reservoir models that are developed based on the pattern recognition technologies collectively known as Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining (AI&DM) is introduced. The workflows developed based on this new class of reservoir simulation and modeling tools break new ground in modeling fluid flow through porous media by providing a completely new and different angle on reservoir simulation and modeling. The philosophy behind this modeling approach and its major commonalities and differences with numerical and analytical models are explored and two different categories of such models are explained. Details of this technology are presented using examples of most recent applications to several prolific reservoirs in the Middle East and in the Gulf of Mexico.AI-based Reservoir Models can be developed for green or brown fields. Since these models are developed based on spatio-temporal databases that are specifically developed for this purpose, they require the existence of a basic numerical reservoir simulator for the green fields while can be developed entirely based on historical data for brown fields. The run-time of AI-based Reservoir Models that provide complete field responses is measured in seconds rather than hours and days (even for a multi-million grid block reservoir). Therefore, providing means for fast track reservoir analysis and AI-assisted history matching are intrinsic characteristics of these models. AI-based Reservoir Models can, in some cases, completely substitute numerical reservoir simulation models, work side by side but completely independent or be integrated with them in order to increase their productivity.Advantages associated with AI-based Reservoir Models are short development time, low development cost, fast track analysis and practical capability to quantify the uncertainties associated with the static model. AI-based Reservoir Model includes a novel design tool for comprehensive analysis of the full field and design of field development strategies to meet operational targets. They have open data requirement architecture that can accommodate a wide variety of data from pressure tests to seismic. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we propose a novel approach, to detect design patterns from software code, that represents various class relationships and attributes in form of class weights and class matrix and then performs safe filtering to optimize the matrix followed by generation of Attributed Relational Graph (ARG) and then usage modified sub-graph isomorphism to match the ARGs. Our approach is based on the XMI standard.

AB  - This paper deals the brand new future memory management in robotics flied. It is a massive challenging issue of this proposal because till now existing database system did not support robotics. While designing the database it is very complex to make a robotic database made with complex designs for the effective data retrieval so here we provide a new concept called NOSQL. It comes under the non-relational database type it can handle the large volumes of data and it can easily process it. It does not have rigid schema design we can apply multiple operations on the single row and in addition we included map reduce concepts it can splits the job to the respective workers so that it can map the data easily in such way that the robots can think, through this map reduce approach we obtain parallelism to processing the large dataset. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Controlling a tendon-driven robot like the humanoid Ecce is a difficult task, even more so when its kinematics and its pose are not known precisely. In this paper, we present a visual motion capture system to allow both real-time measurements of robot joint angles and model estimation of its kinematics. Unlike other humanoid robots, Ecce (see Fig. 1A) is completely molded by hand and its joints are not equipped with angle sensors. This anthropomimetic robot design [5] demands for both (i) real-time measurement of joint angles and (ii) model estimation of its kinematics. The underlying principle of this work is that all kinematic model parameters can be derived from visual motion data. Joint angle data finally lay the foundation for physics-based simulation and control of this novel musculoskeletal robot. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This paper first presents an efficient quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) design for the Ladner-Fischer prefix adder. We then present an efficient QCA design of a hybrid adder that combines the Ladner-Fischer adder with a ripple carry adder. We show that the hybrid adder has better performance (in terms of latency) in QCA than a Ladner-Fischer or a ripple carry adder. We also show that the hybrid adder has a smaller area-delay product than existing adder designs in QCA. Results of simulation in QCADesigner are also given and they support the theory presented. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Quantum cellular automata (QCA) is a new nanotechnology that has attracted attentions due to its lower power consumption, smaller size and higher speed compared to CMOS technology. Majority and inverter gates together make a universal set in QCA circuits. An important step in designing QCA circuits is reducing the number of required cells. This paper introduces the structure of QCA and its basic circuits and then proposes a method to reduce the number of cells used in designing these circuits based on genetic algorithm. The results of this method compared with previous methods indicate a significant improvement in terms of number of cells used in the synthesis of QCA circuits. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The two mature disciplines, namely Data Mining and Data Warehousing have broadly the same set of objectives. Yet, they have developed largely separate from each other resulting in different techniques being used in each discipline. It has been recognized that mining techniques developed for pattern recognition such as Clustering and Visualization can assist in designing data warehouse schema. However, a suitable methodology is required for the seamless integration of mining methods in the design of warehouse schema. In previous work, we presented a methodology that employs hierarchical clustering to derive a tree structure that can be used by a data warehouse designer to build a schema. We believe that, in order to strengthen the decision making process, there is a strong need for a method that automatically extracts knowledge present at different levels of abstraction from a warehouse. We demonstrate with examples how mining at different levels of a hierarchical warehouse schema can give new insights about the underlying data cluster which not only helps in building more meaningful dimensions and facts for data warehouse design but can also improve the decision making process. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In this paper a new class of reservoir models that are developed based on the pattern recognition technologies collectively known as Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining (AI&DM) is introduced. The workflows developed based on this new class of reservoir simulation and modeling tools break new ground in modeling fluid flow through porous media by providing a completely new and different angle on reservoir simulation and modeling. The philosophy behind this modeling approach and its major commonalities and differences with numerical and analytical models are explored and two different categories of such models are explained. Details of this technology are presented using examples of most recent applications to several prolific reservoirs in the Middle East and in the Gulf of Mexico. AI-Based reservoir models can be developed for green or brown fields. Since these models are developed based on spatio-temporal databases that are specifically developed for this purpose, they require the existence of a basic numerical reservoir simulator for the green fields while can be developed entirely based on historical data for brown fields. The run-time of AI-Based reservoir models that provide complete field responses is measured in seconds rather than minutes and hours (even for a multi-million grid block reservoir). Therefore, providing means for fast track reservoir analysis and AI-assisted history matching are intrinsic characteristics of these models. AI-Based Reservoir Models can completely substitute numerical reservoir simulation models, work side by side but completely independent or be integrated with them in order to increase their productivity. Advantages associated with AI-Based Reservoir Models are short development time, low development cost, fast track analysis and have the practical capability to quantify the uncertainties associated with the static model. AI-Based Reservoir Model includes a novel design tool for comprehensive analysis of the full field and design of field development strategies to meet operational targets. They have open data requirement architecture that can accommodate a wide variety of data from pressure tests to seismic. Copyright 2011, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - The ternary Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (tQCA) were demonstrated to be a possible candidate for the implementation of a future multi-valued processing platform. Recent papers show that the application of adiabatic pipelining can be used to solve the issues of tQCA logic primitives. The architectures of the resulting tQCAs are similar to their binary counterparts and the physical design rules remain similar to those for the binary QCA domain. The design of complex processing structures is, however, usually based on logic design. The foundation of logic design is a functionally complete set of elementary logic primitives (functions). The currently available tQCA logic primitives, i.e. tQCA majority gate and tQCA inverter gate, do not constitute a functionally complete set. We here present a tQCA implementation of the ternary characteristic functions, which together with the tQCA majority gate and the ternary constants constitute a functionally complete set according to multi-valued Post logic. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The main methodological design innovation over existing state of the art solutions was the adoption of so called minority gates in addition to the more traditional majority voters. Exploiting this widened basic block set, we obtained a more compact, and thus less expensive circuit. Moreover, the layout was designed in order to comply with the rules for robustness again noise paths [6]. © 2011 EDAA.

AB  - It is well known that software maintenance and evolution are expensive activities, both in terms of invested time and money. Reverse engineering activities support the obtainment of abstractions and views from a target system that should help the engineers to maintain, evolve and eventually re-engineer it. Two important tasks pursued by reverse engineering are design pattern detection and software architecture reconstruction, whose main objectives are the identification of the design patterns that have been used in the implementation of a system as well as the generation of views placed at different levels of abstractions, which let the practitioners focus on the overall architecture of the system without worrying about the programming details it has been implemented with. In this context we propose an Eclipse plug-in called MARPLE (Metrics and Architecture Reconstruction Plug-in for Eclipse), which supports both the detection of design patterns and software architecture reconstruction activities through the use of basic elements and metrics that are mechanically extracted from the source code. The development of this platform is mainly based on the exploitation of the Eclipse framework and plug-ins as well as of different Java libraries for data access and graph management and visualization. In this paper we focus our attention on the design pattern detection process. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cellular Automata (CA) are a standard theoretical model of uniform parallel computation on a grid of cells. They can be looked upon as a discrete type of dynamic systems. As such, they are important tools for modeling spatially distributed processes of different kind - from ecology, through biology, and artificial life, to economics. They are also a useful theoretical model for studying classes of computational complexity. We are interested in the ability of CA to converge to a fixed point with interesting properties, which are quantized by an objective function. In this way, CA qualify as a promising embryogenic representation for Evolutionary Design. Moreover, by modifying the original CA concept by allowing irregular mesh, we can achieve a more flexible and compact representation resulting in faster evolutionary progress. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Tools for design pattern detection (DPD) can ease program comprehension, helping programmers understand the design and intention of certai n parts of a system's implementation. Many tools have been proposed in the past. However, the many different output formats used by the tools make it difficult to compare their results and to improve their accuracy and performance through data fusion. In addition, all the output formats have been shown to have several limitations in both their forms and contents. Consequently, we develop DPDX, a rich common exchange format for DPD tools, to overcome previous limitations. DPDX provides the basis for an open federation of tools that perform comparison, fusion, visualisation, and-or validation of DPD results. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Recovering design pattern instances in a software system can help maintainers to understand its design and implementation. In this paper we present a fully automated design pattern recovery approach that analyzes the behavior of pattern instances both statically and dynamically. In particular, the proposed approach exploits model checking to statically verify the behavioral aspects of design pattern instances. To this end, we encode the properties defining the correct behavior of a pattern as LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formulae and the sequence diagram representing the possible interaction traces among the objects involved in the candidate instances as PROMELA specifications. To verify whether the LTL properties are satisfied by the candidates we employ the SPIN model checking tool. The dynamic analysis of the pattern behavior is performed through a code instrumentation and monitoring phase applied on the candidate pattern instances. This phase allows us to obtain actual dynamic data during program execution, which is then used to verify its compliance to the pattern definition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by presenting and discussing the results obtained on JHotDraw and JRefactory. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Descriptors are utilized to describe important pharmacological attributes such as lipophilicity, electronic, and steric features. Two novel descriptors will be examined by pattern recognition techniques such as cluster analysis, nonhierarchical K-means cluster analyses, discriminant analysis, principal coordinates analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling. The two descriptors are: (A) The ratio of polar surface area to Log P; and (B) The ratio of number of rotatable bonds to number of atoms. A group of thirteen anticancer drugs (including nitrogen mustards, busulfan, nitrosoureas) will be utilized to determine what kind of associations these two descriptors possess in comparison to more widely applied parameters of Log P, molecular volume, number of oxygens and nitrogens, polar surface area, and molecular weight. The numerical values of (A) exhibited a broad range from a negative -202.69 to as high as 8030.8; a feature for this descriptor which may allow very high resolution of drug differentiation. In contrast, the numerical values of (B) were largely fractional and less than one, which could help define fundamental and critical clinical attributes. Cluster analysis showed that descriptors (A) and (B) are significantly distinct from each other, a finding supported by principal coordinates analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, and K-means cluster analysis. Descriptor (A) is shown to be highly distinct from the remaining eight property descriptors. However, (B) is consistently shown to be closely related to Log P, number of atoms, number of rotatable bonds, and number of oxygens and nitrogens within a molecule after non-metric multidimensional scaling and principal coordinates analysis. These same pattern recognition methods showed polar surface area to be somewhat distinct from (A) and (B), and feature which may allow finer definition of drug activity due to polar surface area and important but non-distinguishable properties. This study revealed additional characteristics of alkylating anticancer drugs that will benefit the clinical application of these important pharmaceutical agents. © 2008 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a disorder in which an excessive number of blood stem cells develop into the white blood cell group called granulocytes. The anticancer drug Busulfan is a cell cycle non-specific alkylating agent which is utilized to maintain white blood cell counts below 15000 cells/microliter. The side effects induced by busulfan are significant and affirms the intimation for new drug constructs. Fifteen analogous compounds were generated from the molecular structure of busulfan. These compounds retain the double methanesulfonate functional groups descriptive of this class of alkylating anticancer drugs. However, the carbon chain substituent separating the methanesulfonate is highly modified in order to allow significant changes in drug properties that may produce favorable characteristics that benefit clinical application. Important properties such as Log P, polar surface area, formula weight, molecular volume, Log BB, and violations of the Rule of 5 were determined to ascertain similarities and differences. All fifteen analog compounds retained zero violations of the Rule of 5, which suggests favorable properties for useful drug availability. Values of Log BB and BB remained the same throughout at-0.841 and 0.144, respectively. In addition, values of polar surface area and number of oxygens and nitrogens remained the same throughout at 86.752 A3 and 6, respectively. However, formula weight, number of atoms, number of rotatable bonds varied significantly with Log P varying across a broad range (-0.428 to 2.734). The variance in Log P within this group of methane sulfonate compounds allows new and potentially highly beneficial pharmacological properties for clinical application. Pattern recognition techniques such as cluster analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling, discriminant analysis, and K-means cluster analysis discerned underlying relationships within this group of anticancer drugs and to the parent busulfan. This work shows that pattern recognition methods combined with molecular modeling can discover and elucidate novel drug designs for the clinical treatment of CML. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Design pattern detection, or rather the detection of structures that match design patterns, is useful for reverse engineering, program comprehension and for design recovery as well as for re-documenting object-oriented systems. Finding design patterns inside the code gives hints to software engineers about the methodologies adopted and the problems found during its design phases, and helps the engineers to evolve and maintain the system. In this paper, we present the results provided by four different design pattern detection tools on the analysis of JHotDraw 6.0b1, a well-known Java GUI framework. We show that the tools generally provide different results, even while evaluating the same system. From this observation, we introduce an approach based on micro structures detection that aims to discard the false positives from the detected results, hence improving the precision of the analyzed tools results. For this purpose we exploit a set of micro structures called design pattern clues, which give useful hints for the detection of design patterns.

AB  - In many object oriented softwares, there are recurring patterns of classes. With the help of these patterns specific design problem can be solved and object oriented design becomes more flexible and reusable. Design Pattern Detection is a part of solutions to Software Engineering difficulties. Mining of design pattern instances is important for program understanding and software maintenance. Hence a reliable design pattern mining is required. Here we are introducing a new method called DNIT (Depth-Node-Input Table) for design pattern detection, which extracts the design patterns which exists at different depths in the rooted directed graph of system under study. ©2010 IEEE.

AB  - Tracing source code elements of an existing Object Oriented software system to the components of a Design Pattern is a key step in program comprehension or re-engineering. It helps, mainly for legacy systems, to discover the main design decisions and trade-offs that are often not documented. In this paper an approach is presented to automatically detect Design Patterns in existing Object Oriented systems by tracing system's source code components to the roles they play in the Patterns. Design Patterns are modelled by high level structural Properties (e.g. inheritance, dependency, invocation, delegation, type nesting and membership relationships) that are checked, by source code parsing, against the system structure and components. The approach allows to detect also Pattern variants, defined by overriding the Pattern structural properties. The approach was applied to some open-source systems to validate it. Results on the detected patterns, discovered variants and on the overall quality of the approach are provided and discussed. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The extraction of design pattern information from software systems can provide conspicuous insight to software engineers on the software structure and its internal charactzeristics. In this demonstration we present ePAD, an Eclipse plug-in for recovering design pattern instances from object-oriented source code. The tool is able to recover design pattern instances through a structural analysis performed on a data model extracted from source code, and a behavioral analysis performed through the instrumentation and the monitoring of the software system. ePAD is fully configurable since it allows software engineers to customize the design pattern recovery rules and the layout used for the visualization of the recovered instances. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The effect of layout in the comprehension of design pattern roles in UML class diagrams is assessed. This work replicates and extends a previous study using questionnaires but uses an eye tracker to gather additional data. The purpose of the replication is to gather more insight into the eye gaze behavior not evident from questionnaire-based methods. Similarities and differences between the studies are presented. Four design patterns are examined in two layout schemes in the context of three open source systems. Fifteen participants answered a series of eight design pattern role detection questions. Results show a significant improvement in role detection accuracy and visual effort with a certain layout for the Strategy and Observer patterns and a significant improvement in role detection time for all four patterns. Eye gaze data indicates classes participating in a design pattern act like visual beacons when they are in close physical proximity and follow the canonical layout, even though they violate some general graph aesthetics. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - In the context of reverse engineering, the recognition of design patterns provides additional information related to the rationale behind the design. This paper presents our approach to the recognition of the behavioral design patterns based on dynamic analysis of Java software systems. The idea behind our solution is to identify a set of rules capturing information necessary to identify a design pattern instance. Rules are characterized by weights indicating their importance in the detection of a specific design pattern. The core behavior of each design pattern may be described through a subset of these rules forming a macrorule. Macrorules define the main traits of a pattern. JADEPT (JAva DEsign Pattern deTector) is our software for design pattern identification based on this idea. It captures static and dynamic aspects through a dynamic analysis of the software by exploiting the JPDA (Java Platform Debugger Architecture). The extracted information is stored in a database. Queries to the database implement the rules defined to recognize the design patterns. The tool has been validated with positive results on different implementations of design patterns and on systems such as JADEPT itself. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Design Patterns are proven solution to common recurring design problems. Design Pattern Detection is most important activity that may support a lot to re-engineering process and thus gives significant information to the designer. Knowledge of design pattern exists in the system design improves the program understanding and software maintenance. Therefore, an automatic and reliable design pattern discovery is required. Graph theoretic approaches have been used for design pattern detection in past. Here we are applying an algorithm which decomposes the graph matching process into K phases, where the value of K ranges from 1 to the minimum of the numbers of nodes in the two graphs to be matched. The effectiveness of this algorithm results from the use of small values of K, and significantly reduces the search and space and producing very good matching between graphs. The same algorithm we are here using for design pattern detection from the system design. © 2010 Kongu Engineering College.

AB  - Design Pattern Detection has been documented so far in the literature. The knowledge of design Pattern existence in the program improves the program understanding and software maintenance. Design pattern is a technology for design reuse. Experts store their experiences in the form of design patterns. Reengineering done by novice users will be successful if a reliable design pattern mining exists. There are 23 design patterns defined by experts. Here we are taking the UML diagrams corresponding to design pattern and corresponding to source code. Our main aim is to find out whether a particular design pattern exists in system design (source code) or not. For this we have extracted the relationship graphs (consisting of nodes and edges), and then tried to detect the design pattern. In this paper we have applied normalized cross correlation and taking design pattern as a template tried to find out its existence in system design. Normalized cross correlation (NCC) has been used extensively for many machine vision applications. Normalized cross correlation has been commonly used to evaluate the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between two images. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - To improve the efficiency and veracity of the detection and analysis of the wheat stripe rust resistance genes, the detection and analysis system for wheat stripe rust resistance genes (SRGDAS) was designed and developed, through introducing the experience and knowledge of the experts in the agricultural domain into computer. This system is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, and combined with the component and framework design thought and technology. Taking the detection method and actual analysis process adopted by domain experts into full consideration, developed the knowledge base, the knowledge acquisition facility, the inference engine, the explanation facility, as well as the friendly man-machine interface. This system is principally used to derive the stripe rust resistance genes from the wheat cultivars according to the phenotypes of the tested wheat cultivars infected by Puccinia striiformis. Additionally, it can analyze the existence credibility of the derived known genes in terms of the all-around information of the wheat cultivars. Adopting the clustering method, it can also process the derived unknown genes according to the wheat cultivars resistance characteristics. This system is applied to practice and validated by the detection and analysis experimental data, which verifies the feasibility and validity of this system.

AB  - This paper presents a review of designs for performing arithmetic operations with Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata (QCA). An overview of implementations of adders, multipliers and dividers is provided. Ripple carry, carry lookahead and conditional sum adder designs are compared. The rather surprising result is that with a carefully tailored full adder, ripple carry adders are faster in QCA than carry lookahead and conditional sum adders. Array and "fast" (Wallace and Dadda) multipliers are compared. Finally a Goldschmidt divider is implemented. All of the designs have been simulated with QCA Designer, a simulator that simplifies the estimation of area and delay. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - At the state of the art, objects oriented applications use data structured in relational databases by exploiting some patterns, like the Domain Model and Data Mapper. These approaches aim to represent data in the 00 way, using objects for representing data entities. Furthermore, we point out that the identification of these patterns can show the link between the object model and the conceptual entities, exploiting their associations to the physical data objects. The aim of this paper is to present a unified perspective for the definition of an integrated approach for software and data reverse engineering. The discussion is carried out by means of a sample application and a comparison with results from current tools.

AB  - One of the principal task in the context of reverse engineering is related to program comprehension activity, that can be performed through different techniques, tools and strategies. To better understand and exploit the knowledge necessary to comprehend an existing system different models and metamodels are necessary to represent the information extracted at different levels of abstraction. In this paper we describe the model we have defined in our Marple (Metrics and Architectures Reconstruction PLug-in for Eclipse) project, whose main objectives are related to design pattern detection and to software architecture reconstruction of an existing system to support program comprehension. We introduce the architecture of the model we have proposed outlining its extensibility features and we describe the implementation of the model through the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). We are interested in using this model as the only data repository for any step of elaboration on the system.

AB  - Most work on steganalysis, except a few exceptions, have primarily focused on providing features with high discrimination power without giving due consideration to issues concerning practical deployment of steganalysis methods. In this work, we focus on machine learning aspect of steganalyzer design and utilize a hierarchical ensemble of classifiers based approach to tackle two main issues. Firstly, proposed approach provides a workable and systematic procedure to incorporate several steganalyzers together in a composite steganalyzer to improve detection performance in a scalable and cost-effective manner. Secondly, since the approach can be readily extended to multi-class classification it can also be used to infer the steganographic technique deployed in generation of a stego-object. We provide results to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Emotional bio-robots have become a hot research topic in last two decades. Though there have been some progress in research, design and development of various emotional bio-robots, few of them can be used in practical applications. The study of emotional bio-robots demands multi-disciplinary co-operation. It involves computer science, artificial intelligence, 3D computation, engineering system modelling, analysis and simulation, bionics engineering, automatic control, image processing and pattern recognition etc. Among them, face detection belongs to image processing and pattern recognition. An emotional robot must have the ability to recognize various objects, particularly, it is very important for a bio-robot to be able to recognize human faces from an image. In this paper, a face detection method is proposed for identifying any human faces in colour images using human skin model and eye detection method. Firstly, this method can be used to detect skin regions from the input colour image after normalizing its luminance. Then, all face candidates are identified using an eye detection method. Comparing with existing algorithms, this method only relies on the colour and geometrical data of human face rather than using training datasets. From experimental results, it is shown that this method is effective and fast and it can be applied to the development of an emotional bio-robot with further improvements of its speed and accuracy. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) refer to various high-tech in-vehicle systems that are designed to increase road traffic safety by helping drivers gain better awareness of the road and its potential hazards as well as other drivers around them. The design of traffic sign recognition, one important subsystem of ADAS, has been a challenge problem for many years and hence become an important and active research topic in the area of intelligent transport systems. The realization of a real-time traffic sign recognition system is usually divided into three stages: detection, tracking and classification. This paper introduces the main difficulties in road sign recognition and briefly surveys the state-of-the-art technologies in this field with further discussions on the potential trend of development of road sign recognition. ©2010 IEEE.

AB  - Detection of design pattern occurrences is part of several solutions to software engineering problems, and high accuracy of detection is important to help solve the actual problems. The improvement in accuracy of design pattern occurrence detection requires some way of evaluating various approaches. Currently, there are several different methods used in the community to evaluate accuracy. We show that these differences may greatly influence the accuracy results, which makes it nearly impossible to compare the quality of different techniques. We propose a benchmark suite to improve the situation and a community effort to contribute to, and evolve, the benchmark suite. Also, we propose fine-grained metrics assessing the accuracy of various approaches in the benchmark suite. This allows comparing the detection techniques and helps improve the accuracy of detecting design pattern occurrences. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Program comprehension is a key prerequisite for the maintainance and analysis of legacy software systems. Knowing about the presence of design patterns or antipatterns in a software system can significantly improve the program comprehension.Unfortunately, in many cases the usage of certain patterns is seldom explicitly described in the software documentation, while antipatterns are never described as such in the documentation. Since manual inspection of the code of large software systems is difficult, automatic or semi-automatic procedures for discovering patterns and antipatterns from source code can be very helpful. In this article we propose detection methods for a set of patterns and antipatterns, using a logic-based approach. We define with help of Prolog predicates both structural and behavioural aspects of patterns and antipatters. The detection results obtained for a number of test systems are also presented. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - A controlled experiment investigating the effect layout has on how students identify design pattern roles in UML class diagrams is presented. Two layout schemes, multi-cluster and orthogonal, are compared with respect to three open source systems and four design patterns. Seventeen students were asked a series of eight design pattern role detection (comprehension) questions for each layout, followed by eight preference rating questions. Results indicate a significant improvement in role detection accuracy with the multi-cluster layout for the strategy pattern and a significant improvement in detection time with the multi-cluster layout for all four patterns. Preference ratings significantly favored the multi-cluster layout for pattern role detection ease. These results can be used to help improve the teaching of design patterns. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Quantum dot cellular automaton (QCA) is an emerging technology in the field of nanotechnology. Reversible logic is emerging as a promising computing paradigm with applications in low-power quantum computing and QCA in the field of very large scale integration (VLSI) design. In this paper, we worked on conservative logic gate (CLG) and reversible logic gate (RLG). We examined that RLG and CLG are two classes of logic family intersecting each other. The intersection of RLG and CLG is parity preserving reversible (PPR) or conservative reversible logic gate (CRLG). We proposed in this paper, three algorithms to find different k × k RLG as well as CLG. Here, we demonstrate only the most promising two proposed gates of different categories. We compared the results with that of the previous Fredkin gate. The result shows that logic synthesis using above two gates will be a promising step towards the low-power QCA design era. We have shown a parity preserving approach to design all possible CLG. We also discuss a coupled Majorityminority-Voter (MmV) in a single nanostructure, dual outputs are driven simultaneously. This MmV gate is used for implementing n variables symmetric functions, testing the conservative gates as we explained that parity must be preserved if Majority and Minority output are same as input as well as output of CLG. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - This paper deals with the topic of performance evaluation of symbol recognition & spotting systems. We propose here a new approach to the generation of synthetic graphics documents containing non-isolated symbols in a real context. This approach is based on the definition of a set of constraints that permit us to place the symbols on a pre-defined background according to the properties of a particular domain (architecture, electronics, engineering, etc.). In this way, we can obtain a large amount of images resembling real documents by simply defining the set of constraints and providing a few pre-defined backgrounds. As documents are synthetically generated, the groundtruth (the location and the label of every symbol) becomes automatically available. We have applied this approach to the generation of a large database of architectural drawings and electronic diagrams, which shows the flexibility of the system. Performance evaluation experiments of a symbol localization system show that our approach permits to generate documents with different features that are reflected in variation of localization results. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This paper presents a design and partial implementation of an embedded system as a part of neural-machine interface (NMI) for neural-controlled artificial legs. We have designed a circuit consisting of 30 analog inputs for sampling signals from 16 EMG (Electromyography) electrodes, a 6 degrees of freedom (DOFs) load cell, 5 force sensitive resistors (FSR), and 3 goniometers. The amplified signals are filtered and converted to digital information, which is stored in a RAM. A special pattern recognition algorithm is then executed on the embedded CPU in association with the flash memory that stores the prior training data to make real time decisions. A preliminary prototype with one analog channel has been built and MPC5566 microcontroller has been used to implement the pattern recognition algorithm to measure the execution time. Measurement results show the feasibility of real time processing of neural controlled artificial legs.

AB  - Detecting design patterns from object-oriented program source-code can help maintainers understand the design of the program. However, the detection precision of conventional approaches based on the structural aspects of patterns is low due to the fact that there are several patterns with the same structure. To solve this problem, we propose an approach of design pattern detection using source-code of before the application of the design pattern. Our approach is able to distinguish different design patterns with similar structures, and help maintainers understand the design of the program more accurately.

AB  - We report a laser-scanning confocal reflectance microscope with a wavelet-profiled point spread function (PSF) for rapid multi-resolution extraction and analysis of microscopic object features. The PSF is generated via holography by encoding a π-phase shifting disk unto a collimated laser beam via a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) that is positioned at the pupil plane of the focusing objective lens. Scaling of the transverse PSF distribution is achieved by selecting a suitable ratio of the π-phase shifting disk radius and the pupil aperture radius. With one and the same objective lens and one SLM to control the phase profile of the pupil function, we produce amplitude PSF distributions that are accurate scaled representations of the circularly-symmetric Mexican hat mother wavelet. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BP neural network based gas sensor array detection pattern recognition has some disadvantages, such as slow convergence and local minimum problem. A modified immune neural network model which combines BP algorithm and immune algorithm is proposed to enhance global search capability and improve the performance of the neural network model. Orthogonal test is adopted to design the study samples of neural network. This ensures the accuracy of neural network while reducing the number of samples. The simulation results show that the proposed pattern recognition method solves the cross sensitivity of gas sensor effectively, overcomes the disadvantages of traditional BP neural network and improves the learning speed and detection accuracy.

AB  - This paper reports an efficient synthesis scheme for pseudorandom pattern generators (PRPGs) of arbitrary length. The n-bit PRPG, synthesized in linear time (O(n)), generates quality pseudorandom patterns leading to a highly efficient test logic for the very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuit. The cascadable structure of proposed n-cell PRPG is utilized to construct the (n + 1)-cell PRPG, in two time steps, without sacrificing the pseudorandomness quality. This eases the design of on-chip test pattern generators for the system-on-achip implementing multiple cores. It avoids the requirement of disparate test hardware for different cores and thereby ensures drastic reduction in the cost of test logic. The effective characterization of nonlinear cellular automata (CA) provides the foundation of such a design. Extensive experimentation confirms the better efficiency of the proposed test structure compared to that of the conventional designs, developed around maximal length CA/linear feedback shift register of O(n3) complexity. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - D-CUBED is a semantic code query system for Java. Its focus is on capturing the semantics of an analyzed program. It provides rich support to investigate the call flow and data flow of a program by using static analysis techniques with the custom model of symbolic instances. The usage scenarios of D-CUBED include: (1) detection of design patterns with the focus on code semantics (the good), (2) discovery of bugs, including a range of security holes (the bad), (3) assessment and improvement of a design by discovering bad design and code practices (the ugly).

AB  - An approach to detecting object oriented design patterns in existing UML models, based on a combination of existing techniques, is described. The current work considered is reviewed briefly. These approaches all look for similarities between the models or programs for the design and the model which define the pattern. From this review, two current methods are selected that have a real ability to detect design patterns at the design level. It is shown that these can work together to improve detection rates. Finally, there are ideas on how this work can be extended to detect more patterns and anti-patterns. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - In the context of reverse engineering, the recognition of design patterns provides additional information related to the rationale behind the design. This paper presents our approach to the recognition of design patterns based on dynamic analysis of Java software. The idea behind our approach is to identify a set of rules capturing information necessary to identify a design pattern instance. Rules are characterized by weights indicating their importance in the detection of a specific design pattern. The core behavior of each design pattern may be described through a subset of these rules forming a macrorule. Macrorules define the main traits of a pattern. JADEPT (JAva DEsign Pattern deTector) is our software for design pattern identification based on this idea. It captures static and dynamic aspects through a dynamic analysis of the software by exploiting the JPDA (Java Platform Debugger Architecture). The extracted information is stored in a database. Queries to the database implement the rules defined to recognize design patterns. The tool has been validated with positive results on different academic implementations of design patterns and on systems as JADEPT itself.

AB  - Detection of design patterns is an important part of reverse engineering. Availability of patterns provides for a better understanding of code and also makes analysis more efficient in terms of time and cost. In recent years, we have observed a continual improvement in the field of automatic detection of design patterns in source code. Existing approaches can detect a fairly broad range of design patterns, targeting both structural and behavioral aspects of patterns. However, it is not straightforward to assess and compare these approaches. There is no common ground on which to evaluate the accuracy of the detection approaches, given the existence of variants and specific code constructs used to implement a design pattern. We propose a systematic approach to constructing a comprehensive test suite for detectors of design patterns. This approach is applied to construct a test suite covering the Singleton pattern. The test suite contains many implementation variants of these patterns, along with such code constructs as method forwarding, access modifiers, and long inheritance paths. Furthermore, we use this test suite to compare three detection tools and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - In the early 1990's we developed a special computer program called UW DigiScope to provide a mechanism for anyone interested in biomedical digital signal processing to study the field without requiring any other instrument except a personal computer. There are many digital filtering and pattern recognition algorithms used in processing biomedical signals. In general, students have very limited opportunity to have hands-on access to the mechanisms of digital signal processing. In a typical course, the filters are designed non-interactively, which does not provide the student with significant understanding of the design constraints of such filters nor their actual performance characteristics. UW DigiScope 3.0 is the first major update since version 2.0 was released in 1994. This paper provides details on how the new version based on MATLAB™ works with signals, including the filter design tool that is the programming interface between UW DigiScope and processing algorithms. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - A multigrid accelerated cellular automata algorithm for two and three dimensional continuum topology optimization problems is presented. The topology optimization problem is regularized using the traditional SIMP approach. The analysis rules are derived from the principle of minimum total potential energy, and the design rules are derived based on continuous optimality criteria interpreted as local Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Three versions of the algorithm are implemented; a cellular automata based design algorithm, a baseline multigrid algorithm for analysis acceleration and a full multigrid integrated analysis and design algorithm. It is shown that the multigrid accelerated cellular automata scheme is a powerful tool to solve topology optimization problems. This is demonstrated quantitatively by comparing the convergence time of the multigrid algorithm for different discretization levels, with that of the same design algorithm where the analysis is performed by a commercial finite element code.

AB  - Although soft-sensors have been widely used for estimating product quality or other key variables, they do not always function well in practice due to changes in process characteristics. The Correlation-based Just-In-Time (CoJIT) modeling has been proposed to cope with changes in process characteristics. In the CoJIT modeling, the samples used for local modeling are selected on the basis of correlation together with distance, since changes in process characteristics are expressed as the difference of the correlation. In addition, the individuality of production devices should be considered when they are operated in parallel. However, the CoJIT modeling cannot cope with the individuality of production devices because it is only applicable to time-series data. In the present work, a new pattern recognition method, referred to as the Nearest Correlation (NC) method is proposed, and it selects samples whose correlations are similar to the query. In addition, the proposed NC method is integrated with the CoJIT modeling. The advantages of the proposed CoJIT modeling with the NC method are demonstrated through a case study of a parallelized CSTR process.

AB  - Given the rapid rise of model-driven software development methodologies, it is highly desirable that tools be developed to support the use of design patterns in this context. This paper presents such a tool, called LAMBDES-DP, with UML diagrams as the software design models. Its theoretical foundation is a descriptive semantics of UML in first order logic, and the design patterns are formally specified in the same language. The tool uses the LAMBDES system to translate the UML diagrams into their descriptive semantics and invokes the theorem prover SPASS to decide whether the design conforms to a pattern. Our experiments show that our tool has significantly lower rates of false positive and false negative errors compared with existing tools. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - Detecting design patterns from object-oriented program source-code can help maintainers understand the design of the program. However, the detection precision of conventional approaches based on the structural aspects of patterns is low due to the fact that there are several patterns with the same structure. To solve this problem, we propose an approach of design pattern detection using source-code of before the application of the design pattern. Our approach is able to distinguish different design patterns with similar structures, and help maintainers understand the design of the program more accurately. Moreover, our technique reveals when and where the target pattern has been applied in an ordered series of revisions of the target program. Our technique is useful to assess what kinds of patterns increase what kinds of quality characteristics such as the maintainability. © 2009 IEEE.

We used the Autonomic System Specification Language (ASSL) to design and specify a self-protecting mechanism that must be incorporated by DMARF. Our overall goal is to have an autonomic computing layer covering DMARF by specifying autonomic properties at each of the pattern recognition stages of the same. Here we present results that complement our related work on the self-healing and self-optimizatin autonomic properties.

AB  - Identification of design patterns can deliver important information to designers. Therefore, automated design pattern detection (DPD) is highly desirable when it comes to understanding unknown code. In this paper, we present the results of evaluating five existing DPD tools on various Java projects. These results motivate our proposal of a novel DPD approach based on data fusion. It combines design pattern candidate sets coming from different tools implementing different DPD techniques. We show that a design pattern can be a witness for the existence of another pattern. Our approach is able (1) to provide correct diagnostics even if the inputs from the evaluated tools were partly wrong and (2) to detect patterns instances not identified by the individual tools. For the Decorator, Visitor and Observer pattern, the witness-based approach yields better precision and recall than provided by any single tool. In particular, it detects 24 out of 30 instances of these patterns missed in our experiments by the evaluated tools. We also found that on the analyzed instances of the Bridge, Mediator and Facade pattern data fusion could not improve results, demonstrating that research into improvements of the basic detection techniques is still necessary. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) were demonstrated to be a possible candidate for the implementation of a future multi-valued processing platform. Recent papers show that the introduction of adiabatic switching and the elegant application of the adiabatic pipelining concept in the QCA logic design can be used to efficiently solve the issues of the elementary ternary QCA logic primitives. The architectures of the resulting ternary QCAs become similar to their binary counterparts and thus the design rules for large circuit design remain similar to those developed for the binary QCA domain. In spite of this the design of the binary QCA SR memorizing cell cannot be directly transferred to the ternary domain, mostly because the control logic cannot properly handle the third value. We here propose a ternary QCA memorizing cell that efficiently exploits the pipelining mechanism at a wire level. It is centered on the circulating memory model (i.e. the memory in motion concept), which proved to be an efficient concept in memorizing cell design in the binary QCA domain. The proposed memorizing cell is capable of serving as one trit (ternary digit) of memory and represents a step forward to the ternary register, one of the basic building blocks of a ternary processor. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - We propose a method to test for significant differences in the levels of clustering between two spatial point processes (cases and controls) while taking into account differences in their first-order intensities. The key advance on earlier methods is that the controls are not assumed to be a Poisson process. Inference and diagnostics are based around the inhomogeneous K-function with confidence envelopes obtained from either resampling events in a nonparametric bootstrap approach, or simulating new events as in a parametric bootstrap. Methods developed are demonstrated using the locations of adult and juvenile trees in a tropical forest. A simulation study briefly examines the accuracy and power of the inferential procedures. © 2008, The International Biometric Society.

AB  - A new methodology is proposed for clustering datasets in the presence of scattered observations. Scattered observations are defined as unlike any other, so traditional approaches that force them into groups can lead to erroneous conclusions. Our suggested approach is a scheme which, under assumption of homogeneous spherical clusters, iteratively builds cores around their centers and groups points within each core while identifying points outside as scatter. In the absence of scatter, the algorithm reduces to k-means. We also provide methodology to initialize the algorithm and to estimate the number of clusters in the dataset. Results in experimental situations show excellent performance, especially when clusters are elliptically symmetric. The methodology is applied to the analysis of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory reports on industrial releases of mercury for the year 2000. © 2008, The International Biometric Society.

AB  - Marginal mean models of temporal processes in event time data analysis are gaining more attention for their milder assumptions than the traditional intensity models. Recent work on fully functional temporal process regression (TPR) offers great flexibility by allowing all the regression coefficients to be nonparametrically time varying. The existing estimation procedure, however, prevents successive goodness-of-fit test for covariate coefficients in comparing a sequence of nested models. This article proposes a partly functional TPR model in the line of marginal mean models. Some covariate effects are time independent while others are completely unspecified in time. This class of models is very rich, including the fully functional model and the semiparametric model as special cases. To estimate the parameters, we propose semiparametric profile estimating equations, which are solved via an iterative algorithm, starting at a consistent estimate from a fully functional model in the existing work. No smoothing is needed, in contrast to other varying-coefficient methods. The weak convergence of the resultant estimators are developed using the empirical process theory. Successive tests of time-varying effects and backward model selection procedure can then be carried out. The practical usefulness of the methodology is demonstrated through a simulation study and a real example of recurrent exacerbation among cystic fibrosis patients. © 2008, The International Biometric Society.

AB  - A retrospective dental study was conducted to evaluate the degree to which pulpal involvement affects tooth survival. Due to the clustering of teeth, the survival times within each subject could be correlated and thus the conventional method for the case-control studies cannot be directly applied. In this article, we propose a marginal model approach for this type of correlated case-control within cohort data. Weighted estimating equations are proposed for the estimation of the regression parameters. Different types of weights are also considered for improving the efficiency. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are investigated and their finite sample properties are assessed via simulations studies. The proposed method is applied to the aforementioned dental study. © 2008, The International Biometric Society.

AB  - The design of binary morphological operators that are translation-invariant and locally defined by a finite neighborhood window corresponds to the problem of designing Boolean functions. As in any supervised classification problem, morphological operators designed from training sample also suffer from overfitting. Large neighborhood tends to lead to performance degradation of the designed operator. This work proposes a multi-level design approach to deal with the issue of designing large neighborhood based operators. The main idea is inspired from stacked generalization (a multi-level classifier design approach) and consists in, at each training level, combining the outcomes of the previous level operators. The final operator is a multi-level operator that ultimately depends on a larger neighborhood than of the individual operators that have been combined. Experimental results show that two-level operators obtained by combining operators designed on subwindows of a large window consistently outperforms the single-level operators designed on the full window. They also show that iterating two-level operators is an effective multi-level approach to obtain better results. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - In solving pattern recognition problems, many ensemble methods have been proposed to replace a single classifier by a classifier committee. These methods can be divided roughly into two categories: serial and parallel approaches. In the serial approach, component classifiers are created by focusing on different parts of the training set in different learning phases. In contrast, without paying special attention to any part of the dataset, the parallel approach generates classifiers independently. By integrating these two techniques and by using a neural network approach for the base classifier, this work proposes a design method for a two-stage committee machine. In the first stage of the approach the entire dataset is used to train an averaging ensemble. Based on the classification results of this first stage, hard-to-classify samples are selected and sent to the second stage. To improve the classification accuracy for these samples, a computationally more intensive bagging ensemble is employed in the second stage. These two neural network ensembles work in series whereas the component neural networks in each of the ensembles are trained in parallel. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.

AB  - This paper presents ontology-based architecture for pattern recognition in the context of static source code analysis. The proposed system has three subsystems: parser, OWL ontologies and analyser. The parser subsystem translates the input code to AST that is constructed as an XML tree. The OWL ontologies define code patterns and general programming concepts. The analyser subsystem constructs instances of the input code as ontology individuals and asks the reasoner to classify them. The experience gained in the implementation of the proposed system and some practical issues are discussed. The recognition system successfully integrates the knowledge representation field and static code analysis, resulting in greater flexibility of the recognition system. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Legacy systems maintenance involves different decisions, often very complex and sometimes requiring high costs and time. Hence studying and applying the right system modernization technique becomes very important for systems evolution. One of the solutions often adopted to modernize a system is the possibility to migrate it towards a SOA architecture. A lot of works in the literature have been done in this direction, which propose methodologies that provide some kind of migration strategy. In the migration process one of the main tasks is related to system comprehension. We often have to analyze not well documented systems, where it is difficult to identify the components which could become services or to recognize the possible problems we could face during the migration process. Software architecture reconstruction is certainly a relevant key activity, which is used for these purposes. In this paper we explore if design pattern detection could be also useful in the migration process: knowing that some design patterns have been applied in the system could give relevant hints to take decisions during migration.

AB  - Design patterns have attracted significant attention in software engineering in the last period. An important reason behind this is that design patterns are potentially useful in both development of new, and comprehension of existing object-oriented design, especially for large legacy systems without sufficient documentation. That is why the problem of design patterns identification is very important. Automating the detection of design pattern instances could be of significant help to the process of reverse engineering large software systems. In this paper we aim at introducing a search based approach for identifying instances of design patterns in a software system. An experimental evaluation of our approach is also provided.©2006-2008 by CCC Publications - Agora University Ed. House.

AB  - Identifying design patterns within an existing software system can support understandability and reuse of the system's core functionality. In this context, incorporating behavioral features into the design pattern recovery would enhance the scalability of the process. The main advantage of the new approach in this paper over the existing approaches is incorporating dynamic analysis and feature localization in source code. This allows us to perform a goal-driven design pattern detection and focus ourselves on patterns that implement specific software functionality, as opposed to conducting a general pattern detection which is susceptible to high complexity problem. Using a new pattern description language and a matching process we identify the instances of these patterns within the obtained classes and interactions. We use a two-phase matching process: i) an approximate matching of class attributes generates a list of candidate patterns; and ii) a structural matching of classes identifies exact matched patterns. One target application domain can be software product line which emphasizes on reusing core software artifacts to construct a reference architecture for several similar products. Finally, we present the result of a case study.

Because design patterns document flexible design ideas, there can be various ways of implementing them. In our approach, not only the exact matches of pattern instances are detected from system source code, but also the variations of pattern candidates can be identified. Based on our method, we provide tool support and perform experiments on different large open-source systems. Copyright 2008 ACM.

AB  - In this paper, we present an approach for enhancing program understanding and reusability through a behavior-driven design pattern recovery process. In this context, incorporating behavioral features would characterize the approach as a goal-driven and scalable pattern recovery process. The proposed technique consists of a feature-oriented dynamic analysis and a two-phase design pattern detection process. The dynamic analysis operates on the system's scenario-driven execution traces and produces a mapping between features and their implementation at class level. For the two-phase design pattern detection, we employ approximate matching and structural matching algorithms to identify the instances of the target design pattern that is described using our proposed Pattern Description Language (PDL). The correspondence between system features and identified design pattern instances can facilitate the construction of more reusable and configurable software components to be maintained. We have implemented an Eclipse plug-in toolkit and have conducted experimentation on three versions of JHotDraw systems to evaluate our approach.

AB  - Software industry demands the development of products at a very fast rate with most effective solutions. For this reason most of the components are desired to be reused again and again. Use of Design Patterns can speed up the process of product development by providing the pre-tested footsteps to follow. Design patterns show their effectiveness from Design phase to maintenance. Design patterns can be analyzed for their quality which is the most necessary aspect of any software structure. This is a metric based study of the design patterns by proposing suitable metrics that are suitable for all the patterns. Higher is the quality of the used design pattern higher will be the quality of the product, with more flexibility towards change and maintenance. We can further extend the paper by determining most suitable design patterns for a problem to solve by providing highly reusable solutions. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - If software design-patterns could be captured and reused then this would be very helpful to reverse-engineering often practiced by those who develop and who maintain software. The ad-hoc nature and informality of this reverse-engineering process however, makes the discovery of these patterns not straightforward. Moreover, a high false positive rate results from trying to detect these design-patterns. Although several static and dynamic analysis approaches have been proposed to overcome these difficulties, each technique cannot be used separately because of different reasons. And, even if this were possible, each technique in isolation cannot address detection of all of the important patterns. We propose a new taxonomy of GoF design patterns that can guide the reverse-engineering process. This new approach not only combines static analysis with dynamic analysis but also adds what we call the implementation-specific analysis. Using it we demonstrate that the reverse engineering process is faster and more accurate.

The random pieces are classified to garment pieces, sleeve pieces, trousers pieces and so on using fuzzy theory, thus the pieces of sweater have an appropriate classifying to fit calculation of technological sheet. We also put forward knot mapping method which can divide a sweater piece into many of symmetry region which is named to Technological Sheet Calculating Region (TSCR), computer system can confirm final TSRCs according precision requirement of technological sheet. Finally, technological sheet of TSRCs which is recognized by computer is calculated by dimension of top and bottom border. Application of sweater CAD demonstrates this method can calculate rapidly the technological sheet of sweater pieces. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - This paper treats the problems involved in the design of logic circuits based on novel processing platform. It begins with description of the ternary quantum-dot cell, an extended classic binary cell. These cells are basic building blocks of quantum-dot cellular automata. They are used to construct simple structures with inputs and output which implement some ternary logic function. These structures are employed as building blocks of larger and more complex circuits. The computer-aided design tool that finds an optimal implementation of a circuit by bottom-up approach is described. The search of a solution is based on iterative deepening. Since searching over all possible solutions is too computationally complex, heuristics are used to reduce the computation time.

AB  - We propose a method for automatic detection of occurrences of design patterns. We also describe its proof-ofconcept implementation and the results of comparative experiments with other tools. The method presented here is able to detect many nonstandard implementation variants of design patterns, while its efficiency is comparable to other state-of-the-art detection tools. Moreover, the method is highly customizable because an analyst can introduce a new pattern retrieval query or modify an existing one and then repeat the detection using the results of earlier source code analysis stored in a relational database.

AB  - This work proposes graceful application of cellular automata (CA) to address a well known design problem in civil engineering. A large number of design alternatives exists regarding the choice of bracing pattern and the placing of braces in a tall steel building frame. The target is to find a cost optimal steel structure through proper placing of braces. In the conventional design procedure, based on the principles of structural engineering, an extremely large number of design alternatives exists, making it nearly impossible to arrive at an appropriate design of the bracing system that may lead to optimum design of the entire structure. The proposed design scheme, developed around the GF(2{3}) CA, offers better alternatives and an easier way to arrive at the near-optimum solution in zero time. The GF(2{3}) CA, defined in Galois extension field, suits the modeling of different braces that are conventionally considered for designing multi-storied steel building frames. A CA state on the other hand, corresponds to bracing pattern of a storey and can be tuned to achieve the desired solution. The exhaustive experimental results point to the fact that the proposed CA based approach is most effective, while considering the design of tall building frames, and can reuse a design for scalability.

AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate the use of learning with non-uniform error-cost as a novel technique to design a multiclass cost-sensitive classifier. We investigate two important aspects of the design. First, we show that the learning is effective enough for active control of the multiclass confusion matrix using the cost-matrix. Second, we study the cases when the classifiers have mild model mismatch problems, and conclude that our design still have better performance compared to the conventional cost-sensitive classifier design. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper we present an optimized design of our miniaturized ion mobility spectrometer. It has significantly improved analytical capabilities compared to our previous prototypes, and it can be manufactured at low cost by simply stacking four easy-to-manufacture parts. Different gases were measured down to low ppb-level concentrations in air to demonstrate the analytical performance. The system was challenged with Dimethyl methylphosphonate, Diisopropyl methylphosphonate, Diethyl cyanophosphonate, 2-Chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, Methyl caproate and 1-Octanol. The resolution of our miniaturized IMS is now sufficient to partly resolve different product ion peaks. However, substance identification by peak position is still difficult. Therefore, a simple pattern recognition algorithm is used for substance identification. Reliable identification of single substances is possible down to low ppb-level concentrations within 3 seconds. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - The success of kernel methods including support vector machines (SVMs) strongly depends on the design of appropriate kernels. While initially kernels were designed in order to handle fixed-length data, their extension to unordered, variable-length data became more than necessary for real pattern recognition problems such as object recognition and bioinformatics. We focus in this paper on object recognition using a new type of kernel referred to as "context-dependent". Objects, seen as constellations of local features (interest points, regions, etc.), are matched by minimizing an energy function mixing (1) a fidelity term which measures the quality of feature matching, (2) a neighborhood criterion which captures the object geometry and (3) a regularization term. We will show that the fixed-point of this energy is a "context-dependent" kernel ("CDK") which also satisfies the Mercer condition. Experiments conducted on object recognition show that when plugging our kernel in SVMs, we clearly outperform SVMs with "context-free" kernels. Copyright 2008 by the author(s)/owner(s).

AB  - The robot assembled electronic nose has extensive applications, such as detecting toxic gases, searching explosives, detecting leakage, etc. Following the robot modular design concept, the paper designs a bionic electronic nose for robot, which has a human-like nasal cavity structure. It can simultaneously detect five kinds of different toxic gases, namely, CO, SO2, H 2S, Cl2 and NH3, by using of electrochemical gas sensor array. The electrochemical gas sensor only responds to the specific gas, and has good selectivity and linear output, so the electronic nose dispenses with the pattern recognition algorithm in measuring multi-type gases simultaneously, which greatly reduces the operation task of olfactory system and improves the detection accuracy and efficiency to meet the robot's real-time requirement, and can be conveniently changed corresponding gas sensors based on the target gases. By virtue of the compact structure, simple mechanical interface and communication interface, not only can the bionic electronic nose be used as a standardized component for all types of robots to help them to accomplish works related to olfaction, but also as a portable electronic nose applied to detect toxic gas in many fields. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - We describe an efficient design for scan-window based object detectors using a general purpose graphics hardware computing (GPGPU) framework. While the design is particularly applied to built a pedestrian detector that uses histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features and the support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, the methodology we use is generic and can be applied to other objects, using different features and classifiers. The GPGPU paradigm is utilized for feature extraction and classification, so that the scan windows can be processed in parallel. We further propose to precompute and cache all the histograms in advance, instead of using integral images, which greatly lowers the computation cost. A multi-scale reduce strategy is employed to save expensive CPU-GPU data transfers. Experimental results show that our implementation achieves a more-than-ten-times speed up with no loss on detection rates. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Recovering design patterns applied in a system can help refactoring the system. Machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied in mining data patterns. However, one of the main obstacles of applying them for design pattern detection is the difficulty of collecting training examples. Unlike other applications, a design pattern instance typically includes a group of classes with certain relationships. Thus, the possible combinations of the group of classes can be enormous which results in huge training sets making the application of machine learning algorithms impracticable. In this paper, we propose an innovative method using matrix transformations to cluster the training examples. Our method can significantly reduce the size of training examples, thus making it possible to be efficiently applied in machine learning algorithm. ©2008 IEEE.

AB  - Interesting and less understood phenomenon of jerky flow - Poitevin Le Chatelier effect (PLC) in polycrystals is studied on the mesoscopic level. Apart from kinetic considerations of the phenomenon, the influence of stress concentrations is considered as a driving force of localization phenomena. The model is based on the recently introduced relaxation element method (REM) which maintains an unambiguous connection between the stress drop in local volumes of solids with the plastic deformation in it in combination with the cellular automata method. REM allows to consider local sites of plastic deformation with the gradients of stresses and strains. Modelling of the underlying mesomechanical mechanisms of this phenomenon in polycrystals of Al6061/Al 2O3 within the approach mentioned above results in the prediction of the PLC-bands self-organization. The results of the simulations are in very good agreement with observed ones in experiments.

AB  - Recovering design pattern usage in source code is a very difficult task. Several tools are described in the literature for this purpose, but there is little work invested in evaluating them. The main reason for this is the lack of an approved benchmark for these tools. In this paper we present work in progress towards creating a benchmark, called DEEBEE (DEsign pattern Evaluation BEnchmark Environment), for evaluating and comparing design pattern miner tools. It is programming language, tool, pattern and software independent, and it is open to the community and freely available. Currently, the benchmark database contains the results of three tools: Columbus (C++), Maisa (C++), and Design Pattern detection Tool (Java). The tools were evaluated on reference implementations of patterns and on open source software (Mozilla, NotePad++, JHotDraw, JRefactory and JUnit). Additionally, instances recovered by researchers are added from NotePad++ as well. Some recovered patterns are already verified by experienced developers. This work is the first step in building a large reference database of design pattern usage in open source software and we expect that researchers will join us in this effort. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - To increase the sensitivity and bandwidth for a tuning fork vibratory microgyroscope, a novel structure with improved spring beams is presented. The shape of the suspension beams are optimized by a Cellular Automata approach. Electrostatic excitation and capacitive detection mechanism are employed. The gyroscope works at atmospheric pressure, and the dominant air damping of the gyroscope is the slide-film damping, which ensures high Q-factors for both driving and sensing modes even at atmospheric pressure. The improved gyroscope is fabricated by the bulk silicon micromachining technology and packaged at atmospheric pressure. Experimental results show that the sensitivity and bandwidth of the microgyroscope are both promoted. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Linear finite-state machines (LFSMs) such as linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs), cellular automata (CA), and ring generators (RGs) are used as test pattern generators in built-in self-test schemes that employ 2-D scan design. These mechanisms are usually accompanied by phase shifters (PSs) in order to avoid the degradation of the fault coverage caused by correlations/dependences in the produced test bit sequences. Given this context, we investigate in this paper the potential of generalized (or Galois) LFSRs (GLFSRs) as onboard test pattern generators. We compare GLFSRs with and without PSs against LFSMs with PSs (LFSM/PSs) for various types of LFSMs (LFSRs, CA, RGs, and dense RGs) on two accounts: channel separation and overall hardware cost. Experimental results show that GLFSRs achieve larger channel separation with lower hardware cost than LFSM/PS and attain higher fault coverage. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - During the last few years, innovative optical design strategies to gnerate and control image mapping have been successful in producing high-resolution digital imagers and projectors. This new generation of panoramic lenses includes catadioptric panoramic lenses, panoramic annular lenses, visible/IR fisheye lenses, anamorphic wide-angle attachments, and visible/IR panomorph lenses. Given that a wide-angle lens images a large field of view on a limited number of pixels, a systematic pixel-to-angle mapping will help the efficient use of each pixel in the field of view. In this paper, we present several modern applications of these modern types of hemispheric lenses. Recently, surveillance and security applications have been proposed and published in Security and Defence symposium. However, modern hemispheric lens can be used in many other fields. A panoramic imaging sensor contributes most to the perception of the world. Panoramic lenses are now ready to be deployed in many optical solutions. Covered applications include, but are not limited to medical imaging (endoscope, rigiscope, fiberscope...), remote sensing (pipe inspection, crime scene investigation, archeology...), multimedia (hemispheric projector, panoramic image...). Modern panoramic technologies allow simple and efficient digital image processing and the use of standard image analysis features (motion estimation, segmentation, object tracking, pattern recognition) in the complete 360o hemispheric area.

AB  - This paper reports a novel application of an electronic nose (e-nose) for recognition and detection of wine ageing. Two different measurements are performed with the following samples: first, in an experimental cellar the same wine is aged in different type of oak barrel (French and American oak) and during different time (0, 3, 6 and 12 months) and second, several wines made with the same grape variety and from different wine cellars aged in French and American oak. This identification has a great importance for origin denominations for control of frauds. The e-nose is home-developed and home-fabricated for this purpose: a tin oxide multisensor prepared with RF sputtering onto an alumina substrate and doped with chromium and indium is used. The sampling method employed is static headspace followed by a dynamic injection. Linear techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) and nonlinear ones like probabilistic neural networks (PNN) are used for pattern recognition. A classification success rate (correct predicted number over total number of measurements) of 97% and 84% is achieved in detection of the different ageing process experimented by the wines tested. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper mainly concern about the development of an SOPC based image and control strategy system for a small size humanoid robot. The main function of the image system is pattern recognition. Several geometric figures and the direction of arrows can be recognized in a complex environment at the same time. The image information is captured by the CMOS sensor. The colors and noise will be filtered out first. Moreover, the edge detection approach is utilized to find the feature points so as to analyze the image. The control strategy conforms to the laws of Penalty Kick and other events of the FIRA competition. We describe the methods of the offense and defense modes and other strategies. Our robot can track specific objects via the CMOS sensor controlled by two small servomotors. The motions of the robot are decided by analyzing the condition of the environment from the captured image. Finally, the experiment results show the capability of pattern recognition and the efficiency and validity in the HuroCup of the FIRA.

AB  - Motivation: The prediction of biologically active compounds is of great importance for high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches in drug discovery and chemical genomics. Many computational methods in this area focus on measuring the structural similarities between chemical structures. However, traditional similarity measures are often too rigid or consider only global similarities between structures. The maximum common substructure (MCS) approach provides a more promising and flexible alternative for predicting bioactive compounds. Results: In this article, a new backtracking algorithm for MCS is proposed and compared to global similarity measurements. Our algorithm provides high flexibility in the matching process, and it is very efficient in identifying local structural similarities. To predict and cluster biologically active compounds more efficiently, the concept of basis compounds is proposed that enables researchers to easily combine the MCS-based and traditional similarity measures with modern machine learning techniques. Support vector machines (SVMs) are used to test how the MCS-based similarity measure and the basis compound vectorization method perform on two empirically tested datasets. The test results show that MCS complements the well-known atom pair descriptor-based similarity measure. By combining these two measures, our SVM-based model predicts the biological activities of chemical compounds with higher specificity and sensitivity. © 2008 The Author(s).

AB  - One of the approaches to improve program understanding is to extract what kinds of design pattern are used in existing objectoriented software. This paper proposes a technique for efficiently and accurately detecting occurrences of design patterns included in source codes. We use both static and dynamic analyses to achieve the detection with high accuracy. Moreover, to reduce computation and maintenance costs, detection conditions are hierarchically specified based on Pree's meta patterns as common structures of design patterns. The usage of Prolog to represent the detection conditions enables us to easily add and modify them. Finally, we have implemented an automated tool as an Eclipse plug-in and conducted experiments with Java programs. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - Software system evolutions can be supported through different techniques and by exploiting different tools. We concentrate our attention on the advantages we gain through design recovery, and in particular on sub-component recovery, which helps to detect logical components of the system and their relationships. Components can be of various kinds: an important category is that of Design Patterns [7]. Several approaches have been proposed to automate design pattern detection. In this paper we describe our approach to design pattern detection using supervised classification and data mining techniques based on sub-components, and summarize the results we obtained on behavioral Design Patterns. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Quantum Cellular Automata, also known as QCA, has been touted as a pragmatic use of quantum phenomena which currently are detrimental in nano-transistor technology. Recently, QCA technologies has expanded into magnetism [1][2], an area referred to as Magnetic QCA, by exploiting the magnetic coupling interaction between neighboring cells (nano-magnets). The interactions of orderly fabricated nano-magnets and the viability of nano-magnetic structures as logical building blocks has yet to be explored in great detail. We have fabricated nano-scale Magnetic QCA cells and currently the scope entails determining how factors such as material, size, placement, and surface roughness affect the magnetic properties and coupling interactions between the nano-magnetic QCA cells. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Pen-based interaction is an intuitive way to realize hand drawn structured documents, but few applications take advantage of it. Indeed, the interpretation of the user hand drawn strokes in the context of document is a complex problem. In this paper, we propose a new generic approach to develop such systems based on three independent components. The first one is a set of graphical and editing functions adapted to pen interaction. The second one is a rule-based formalism that models structured document composition and the corresponding interpretation process. The last one is a hand drawn stroke analyzer that is able to interpret strokes progressively, directly while the user is drawing. We highlight in particular the human-computer interaction induced from this progressive interpretation process. Thanks to this generic approach, three pen-based system prototypes have already been developed, for musical score editing, for graph editing, and for UML class diagram editing. © 2007 Springer.

Since then, it has evolved into a complete reverse-engineering tool suite that includes several identification algorithms. It is a flexible tool suite that attempts to ease as much as possible the development of new identification and analysis algorithms. Recently, the module DECOR has been added to PTIDEJ and allows the detection of design defects, which are recurring design problems. In this demonstration, we particularly focus on the creation and use of identification algorithms for design patterns and defects.

AB  - In terms of mounting a computer on the body, the computer's weight, size, shape, placement and method of attachment can elicit a number of effects. Inappropriate design may mean that the wearer is unable to perform specific tasks or achieve goals. Excessive stress on the body may result in perceptions of discomfort, which may in turn affect task performance, but ultimately raises issues of health and safety. This paper proposes a methodology for assessing the affects of wearing a computer in terms of physiological energy expenditure, the biomechanical effects due to changes in movement patterns, posture and perceptions of localised pain and discomfort due to musculoskeletal loading, and perceptions of well-being through comfort assessment. From ratings of these effects the paper proposes 5 levels to determine the wearability of a computer. ©2006 IEEE.

AB  - Frequent pattern mining is one of the fundamental techniques for knowledge discovery and data mining. During the last decade, several efficient algorithms for frequent pattern mining have been presented, but most algorithms have focused on enumerating the patterns that satisfy the given conditions, considering the storage and indexing of the pattern results for efficient inductive analysis to be a separate issue. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for extracting all/maximal frequent patterns from transaction databases and simultaneously indexing a huge number of patterns using Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZBDDs). Our method is comparably fast as existing state-ofthe-art algorithms and not only enumerates/lists the patterns but also compactly indexes the output data in main memory. After mining, the pattern results can be analyzed efficiently by using algebraic operations. BDD-based data structures have previously been used successfully in VLSI logic design, but our method is the first practical application of BDD-based techniques in the data mining area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - In this paper we present a new class of one-dimensional cellular automata which does not have the design complexity of two dimensional cellular automata but achieves higher fault coverage than the two most commonly used maximal length linear finite state machines: linear hybrid cellular automata and linear feedback shift registers. This class of cellular automata is based on a five-cell neighbourhood, giving it a much richer transition structure, but still keeping the interconnection complexity very low. A recurrence relation is given to enable the efficient calculation of the characteristic polynomial. The effectiveness of the new cellular automata is investigated by using them as generators for built-in self-test of the ISCAS 85 and ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits. While the resulting fault coverage is never worse than using the traditional linear feedback shift register as the generator, in about half of the circuits the fault coverage is significantly improved, in some cases by more than 20%. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Methods that can screen large databases to retrieve a structurally diverse set of compounds with desirable bioactivity properties are critical in the drug discovery and development process. This paper presents a set of such methods, which are designed to find compounds that are structurally different to a certain query compound while retaining its bioactivity properties (scaffold hops). These methods utilize various indirect ways of measuring the similarity between the query and a compound that take into account additional information beyond their structure-based similarities. Two sets of techniques are presented that capture these indirect similarities using approaches based on automatic relevance feedback and on analyzing the similarity network formed by the query and the database compounds. Experimental evaluation shows that many of these methods substantially outperform previously developed approaches both in terms of their ability to identify structurally diverse active compounds as well as active compounds in general.

Here, we describe the light speckles produced from different colour LEDs to design and implement a new optical computer mouse. The speckle pattern will be used also to determine the velocity of the device relative to the surface it slides on it. The most important and critical property of speckles is their average diameter, which is independent of the type of the surface being illuminated by coherent (He-Ne laser and diode laser) or partially coherent light (LEDs). The average diameter of a speckle pattern is function of the diameter of the illuminated area of the surface, the distance between the surface and the detector, and the wavelength of the used light. In this work, we replaced the laser source by a small powerful white light lamp with different optical coloured filters and studying the resulting coloured speckle patterns to investigate the effect of different wavelengths on the velocity of the device relative to the surface it slides on it.

AB  - As the photomask design rules continue to shrink towards 45nm and below, the defect classification criteria is becoming more challenging to be set accurately. Pattern fidelity issues and masks defects that were once considered insignificant or merely nuisances are now yield-limiting. On the other hand, there are still cases of small defects captured during reticle inspection but will not print on the wafer. In addition, in a production setting environment it is critical to ascertain quickly and efficiently the true lithographic effect of reticle defects in order to avoid yield and cycle time impacts. As a starting point, it is best to inspect the reticle at the highest sensitivity to find all defects and anomalies. From there, fast and efficient means to sort and prioritize defects are necessary for inspection operators' and engineers' convenience. Then, it is critical to model all the defects accurately for their lithographic impact. Finally, an accurate lithographybased set of reticle defect disposition criteria can be developed for the manufacturing process flow. The focus of this study is on contact or hole patterns since the issues regarding capture of defects on such patterns are typically more complex than the ones on line and space patterns. The intent is to assess and devise defect disposition criteria for contact hole layers utilizing KLA-Tencor's 5X6 DUV inspection system with both standard die-to-die and Litho2 algorithms and the Automated Mask Defect Disposition (AMDD) system. AMDD lithographic printability results will be compared to AIMS results and printed results on wafer.

AB  - In this paper we evaluate logic code analysis and transformation frameworks for their suitability as basic infrastructures for fast detection and extraction of (crosscutting) concerns. Using design patterns as example concerns, we identify desirable properties that an infrastructure should fulfill. We then report our initial results of evaluating candidate systems with respect to these properties. We show how high precision design pattern detectors can be easily formulated as predicates that are evaluated in mere seconds even on the sources of large software systems, such as the Eclipse IDE. Although details still remain to be analyzed further, our current results suggest that the pair JTransformer & CTC is a good candidate for a general infrastructure, combining very good querying performance, scalability and short turn-around times with a seamless integration of querying and transformation capabilities.

AB  - Design patterns have been used successfully in recent years in the software engineering community in order to share knowledge about the structural and behavioural properties of software. There is a growing body of research in the area of design pattern detection and design recovery, requiring a formal description of patterns which can be matched by tools against the software that is to be analysed. We propose a novel approach to the formal definition of design patterns that is based on the idea that design patterns are knowledge that is shared across a community and that is by nature distributed and inconsistent. By using the web ontology language (OWL) we are able to formally define design patterns and some related concepts such as pattern participant, pattern refinement, and pattern instance. We discuss the respective ontology and give examples of how patterns can be defined using this ontology. We present the prototype of a Java client that accesses the pattern definitions and detects patterns in Java software, and analyse some scan results. This leads to the discussion on design pattern instantiation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As a result of resource limitations, state in branch predictors is frequently shared between uncorrelated branches. This interference can significantly limit prediction accuracy. In current predictor designs, the branches sharing prediction information are determined by their branch addresses and thus branch groups are arbitrarily chosen during compilation. This feasibility study explores a more analytic and systematic approach to classify branches into clusters with similar behavioral characteristics. We present several ways to incorporate this cluster information as an additional information source in branch predictors. Our profile-based results demonstrate that cluster information is useful in various branch prediction schemes. When clustered indexing is applied, the same performance can be obtained with 2-8 times less hardware budget. For small predictor budgets, clustered indexing is very cost-effective, e.g., the misprediction rate in an 8 Kib gshare is reduced 12.3% on average for SPEC CPU2000 INT. For large budgets up to 4 Mib, clustered indexing reduces the number of mispredictions by 3-5%, or stated otherwise only half the hardware budget is required to obtain the same performance as the original gshare scheme. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The concept of Interaction Locus (IL) has been introduced to help the users to orient, navigate, and identify relevant interaction areas in 3D Virtual Environments (VEs). The IL is a multimodal concept: it adds to the 3D visual scene parallel information channels that are perceived by other senses. In particular, the IL emphasizes the role of music as a navigation aid in a VE. This paper reports three user-evaluations of different IL enriched virtual worlds, and in particular of the role of the IL auditory component. Results suggest that audio in 3D plays not only an aesthetic role, which the users greatly appreciate, but also a functional role simplifying navigation and helping the users to recognise scenes in the environment. Such a functional role however is subordinated to a proper understanding of the link between music and virtual space. While these experiments refer to desktop virtual reality environments, their findings are general enough to inform the design of navigational tools for other segments of the mixed reality domain. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

AB  - Design patterns are micro architectures that have proved to be reliable, robust and easy to implement. Detecting design pattern from source code of object-oriented system can help a designer, a developer or a maintainer to understand the software system. In this paper, a new method is provided which can detect design patterns from source code combining both static and dynamic analysis. To acquire the run-time dynamic information of software systems, a code instrumentation method is adopted. At the same time, all static and dynamic information is presented in UML diagrams format. The pattern detection process and its detection results are visual and interactive. This method is tested on a call center and a traffic simulation system. Experimental results prove that the method is effective in design patterns detection. © Shanghai University 2007.

AB  - This paper presents a new set of features for the machine inspection of solder joints. The present approach is very attractive for industrial applications mainly due to its simplicity in illumination and classification method, efficiency in computation time and robustness to changes in the illumination condition and the pad size. It is remarkable that the present approach requires only one layer of tiered light, and its classification method makes use of only two features so that insufficient, acceptable and excessive solders can be divided into three classes by two straight lines on the two-dimensional feature plane. And it has been verified by experiments that it can acutely discriminate solder joints of different classes. The simplicity, reliability and computational efficiency of the present approach are all owing to the careful selection of a set of features which are derived step by step from well-established physical laws, though only in qualitative sense. Hence this paper demonstrates also the advantage of physics-based pattern classification approaches. © Springer-Verlag 2007.

AB  - Facts extracted from source code have been used to support a variety of software engineering activities, ranging from architectural understanding, through detection of design patterns, to program exploration. Several fact extractors have been developed and published in the literature, but most of them extract facts only from individual compilation units. Linking multiple fact-bases is largely overlooked. Source-level linkage is different from compilation linkage. Its goal is to assist a software engineer, not to produce an executable program. Thus a source-level linker needs to collect as many as possible facts that may be potentially helpful to a software engineer's task, many of which are not available from a compiler linker. We present the design of a source-level linker for C++. This linker has been used to analyze a dozen of Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) programs and over 200 C++ programs that cover an extensive subset of C++ features, including templates from the Standard Template Library (STL). As a further validation, we design a Structural Constraint Language, SCL, to express and machine-check a wide range of constraints on the Abstract Semantics Graph (ASG) produced by the linker. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Many structural analyses of software systems are naturally formalized as relational queries, for example, the detection of design patterns, patterns of problematic design, code clones, dead code, and differences between the as-built and the as-designed architecture. This paper describes CrocoPat, an application-independent tool for relational programming. Through its efficiency and its expressive language, CrocoPat enables practically important analyses of real-world software systems that are not possible with other graph analysis tools, in particular analyses that involve transitive closures and the detection of patterns in graphs. The language is easy to use, because it is based on the well-known first-order predicate logic. The tool is easy to integrate into other software systems, because it is a small command-line tool that uses a simple text format for input and output of relations.

AB  - During reverse engineering, developers often need to understand the undocumented design of a software. In particular, recognizing design patterns in the software can provide reverse engineers with considerable insight on the software structure and its internal characteristics. Researchers have therefore proposed techniques based on static analysis to automatically recover design patterns in a program. Unfortunately, most design patterns comprise not only structural, but also significant behavioral aspects. Although static analysis is well suited for the recognition of structural aspects, it is typically limited and imprecise in analyzing behavior. To address this limitation, we present a new technique that complements our existing static analysis with a dynamic analysis, so as to perform a more accurate design-pattern recognition. The dynamic analysis is based on (1) transforming behavioral aspects of design patterns into finite automata, (2) identifying and instrumenting relevant method calls, and (3) monitoring relevant calls at runtime and matching them against the automata. The results of the dynamic analysis are then used to compute the likelihood of a pattern to be in the code. This paper describes our technique and presents a preliminary empirical study performed to assess the technique. Copyright 2006 ACM.

AB  - Graph Theory, which studies the properties of graphs, has been widely accepted as a core subject in the knowledge of computer scientists. So is Object-Oriented (OO) software engineering, which deals with the analysis, design and implementation of systems employing classes as modules. The latter field can greatly benefit from the application of Graph Theory, since the main mode of representation, namely the class diagram, is essentially a directed graph. The study of graph properties can be valuable in many ways for understanding the characteristics of the underlying software systems. Representative examples for the usefulness of graph theory on OO systems based on recent research results are presented in this paper. Copyright 2006 ACM.

AB  - This paper focuses on the development of EDDIE, a flexible low-cost emotion-display with 23 degrees of freedom. Actuators are assigned to particular action units of the facial action coding system (FACS). Emotion states represented by the circumplex model of affect are mapped to individual action units. Thereby, continuous, dynamic, and realistic emotion state transitions are achieved. EDDIE is largely developed and manufactured in a rapid-prototyping process. Miniature off-the-shelf mechatronics components are used providing high functionality at low-cost. Evaluations conducted in a user-study show that emotions can be recognized very well. Further experiments show that additional features adapted from animals have significant but small influence on the display of the human emotion 'disgust'. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - In the last decade, face analysis, e.g. face recognition, face detection, face tracking and facial expression recognition, is a very lively and expanding research field. As computer animated agents and robots bring a social dimension to human computer interaction, interest in this research field is increasing rapidly. In this paper, we introduce an artificial facial expression mimic system which can recognize facial expressions of human and also imitate the recognized facial expressions. We propose a classifier that is based on weak classifiers obtained by using modified rectangular features to recognize human facial expression in real-time. Next, we introduce our robot that is manipulated by a distributed control algorithm and that can make artificial facial expressions. Finally, experimental results of facial expression recognition and facial expression generation are shown for the validity of our artificial facial expression imitator. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Two-photon 3D microfabrication has become one research focus in MEMS field. The main factors influencing the fabrication precision are discussed in this paper. One factor is decided by the characteristics of the two-photon polymerization, includes the power of the Femtosecond (fs) laser, the exposing time and the overlap ratio, etc. The other is mainly induced by the movement error of machining system. According to these factors, the high precision formation mechanism is proposed. Through experiment and theory analysis, the machining process parameters are optimized. In order to compensate the movement error of the scanning stage, a vision monitoring system based on image process and pattern recognition is developed. The experiment results show the availability of these methods. ©2006 IEEE.

AB  - This paper, for the first time, presents the accurate results of coupled fabrication process simulation and mechanical performance analysis of microstructures using cellular automata (CA) method. According to the process sequences and process parameters, the microstructures are accurately generated using the CA method. The mechanical performance of the microstructures obtained is then analyzed using CA method with the material properties definition. Thus the fabrication process simulation and mechanical performance analysis of microstructures are seamlessly linked based on the CA method. The comparison of results from mechanical performance analysis using the CA method and ANSYS demonstrates that the effects of exact fabrication process can be efficiently expressed. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Recent research suggests design pre-patterns, structured collections of evidence-based research and design knowledge, provide a useful resource for design activities in emerging application domains. This paper extends previous research by exploring the impact of pre-patterns and tools to support pre-pattern exploration for the domain of ubiquitous computing in the home. We conducted an empirical study of 44 designers engaged in a two hour concentrated brainstorming and design task for the home of the future. Our results show pre-patterns are an easily adopted resource for designers that can impact even the earliest of design activities. We also provide insights for future development of pre-patterns based on designer feedback. Copyright 2006 ACM.

AB  - The identification of design patterns as part of the reengineering process can convey important information to the designer. However, existing pattern detection methodologies generally have problems in dealing with one or more of the following issues: identification of modified pattern versions, search space explosion for large systems and extensibility to novel patterns. In this paper, a design pattern detection methodology is proposed that is based on similarity scoring between graph vertices. Due to the nature of the underlying graph algorithm, this approach has the ability to also recognize patterns that are modified from their standard representation. Moreover, the approach exploits the fact that patterns reside in one or more inheritance hierarchies, reducing the size of the graphs to which the algorithm is applied. Finally, the algorithm does not rely on any pattern-specific heuristic, facilitating the extension to novel design structures. Evaluation on three open-source projects demonstrated the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - The versatility of light-emitting conjugated polymers in terms of optoelectronic properties is enormous, but tailoring of other essential properties has been relatively limited. In other fields such a problem would be rectified using material formulations. However, the need to maintain high optoelectronic compatibility between components has hampered such development. In this paper, careful design of electronically compatible materials is demonstrated. Additive molecules that are compatible with a family of luminescent polymers are presented, and their performance in a light-emitting diode configuration is demonstrated. This formulation is aimed to adjust the glass-transition temperature, maintain/improve film-forming ability, and introduce a crosslinking functionality. It is found that, by using electronic formulations, a robust procedure is obtained that could be used to produce waveguide lasers or full-color displays. The patterning ability is shown via the construction of a single pixel that is half green and half orange. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel approach for designing a variety of large textures from a single small sample texture. Firstly, the original small texture is segmented into layers, each of which contains one particular texture element. Secondly, each layer is deformed using a set of chaotic-based transformation operations. Thirdly, all the deformed layers are added together to form a new texture, which is a natural variation of the original sample texture. Since each layer is deformed independently, adding the deformed layers together usually results in a texture with overlapping regions and holes. We employ the graphcut algorithm and an example-based image inpainting technique to seamlessly patch the overlapping regions and to fill the holes. Moreover, an optimized graphcut synthesis algorithm and a new cyclic texture synthesis technique are also developed for efficiently creating large seamless textures. As a result, our approach shows particular strength in generating a large variety of textures from a single sample texture while avoiding highly repetitive patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can also be used for other texture synthesis applications, such as texture synthesis from multiple samples.

AB  - Diffractive diffusers have some desirable characteristics, whereas they have a large dependence on wavelengths. For their application over a wide wavelength range, achromatization is planned for diffractive-type optical diffusers. A diffracted pattern can be achromatized by fixing the ratio of each optical path area and optimizing the multiwavelength diffracted patterns simultaneously. Subwavelength pillar structures are used for multilevel optical path regions. We fabricated test pieces to demonstrate this method. Patterns were formed by KrF and ArF stepper lithography and dry etching, and then replicated to resin by UV nanoimprint. Simulations and measurements gave similar results, which suggests that these methods for achromatization work well. Diffractive white-light diffusers will be realized when elements with subwavelength high-aspect-ratio pillar structures are fabricated precisely as designed. © 2006 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

AB  - A mathematical model for prediction of antioxidant activity (AOA) with a recognition level of ∼90% was developed using the SARD-21 computer system. Based on this model, structural modification of ionol and 5-hydroxy-6- methyluracil was carried out. A set including 32 potential antioxidants was generated. The interval levels of toxicity were theoretically predicted and the effect of structural fragments on the toxic properties of the most efficient potential antioxidants was analyzed. Structural attributes characteristic of highly efficient, low-toxicity antioxidants were revealed for the first time. Based on complex analyses of the AOA and toxicity, thirteen structures of potentially efficient low-toxicity antioxidants were proposed. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - The interest on biometric recognition systems for person authentication has experienced an important growth in the last decade. One of the key factors of this success is the availability of biometric databases; these are of utmost importance to define common benchmarks that enable consistent comparison of competing recognition strategies. The design, acquisition, and collection of these databases are one of the most time- and resource-consuming tasks for the research community, especially in the case of multimodal databases including multiple biometric traits and acquisition sessions. In this paper, the most important multimodal biometric databases publicly available are summarized, and the contents of some new multimodal databases under development are outlined. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Colour is not one single kind of "thing." Here I propose a way of categorizing the different kinds of thing that colours are variously understood to be. I further propose that the means used to identify a colour determine what kind of thing it is that is being identified. My proposed categories are conventional colour, substance colour, formula colour, spectral profile colour, psychophysical colour, inherent colour, and perceived colour. I show how these different kinds of colour are the concern of people working in different disciplines and that these different disciplines all contribute knowledge that can be of value in colour design. I also show how recognition of the different kinds of colour can help designers to a clearer understanding of concepts that they use in their own discipline. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Based on projective contour a retrieval algorithm is proposed. First, the statistical arithmetical area is deduced by calculating the normal area and the maximum one is achieved, then the corresponding vector is gained and the projection orientation is determined. Secondly, the 3D model is transformed based on the projection orientation. So projection can be accomplished and three contours are achieved. Integrated similarity can then be calculated by comparing waves according to three contours. 3D models are transformed into 2D, which makes the comparability simple by decreasing the complexity of calculation. The results indicate that this method is promising in many fields, such as virtual reality, industrial design, animation, mechanical design and filming.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a framework for virtual reality, I 2-NEXT, which enables users to interact with virtual objects by tangible objects in immersive networked virtual environment. The primary goal of this framework is to support rapid development of immersive and interactive virtual reality systems as well as various types of user interfaces. The proposed framework consists of user interface for interactions, immersive virtual environment, and networking interface. In this framework, we adopt several design patterns to guarantee that either developers or users (artists) can easily implement their VR applications without strong knowledge of VR techniques such as programming, libraries etc. One of the key features of this framework is the presence of the device module which supports a natural user interaction in a virtual environment. For example, the proposed framework provides users with tangible objects so that the users are able to manipulate virtual objects by touching real objects. The proposed framework also supports large scale stereoscopic display through clustering technique. To realize the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we have been developing an application for digital heritage reconstruction. Having been through development of the system, we believe that virtual reality technology is one of the promising technologies which enable users to experience realities in a digital space. Detailed explanations of each component and system architecture are presented Copyright © 2006 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

AB  - Boundary logic is a formal diagrammatic system that combines Peirce's Entitative Graphs with Spencer Brown's Laws of Form. Its conceptual basis includes boundary forms composed of non-intersecting closed curves, void-substitution (deletion of irrelevant structure) as the primary mechanism of reduction, and spatial pattern-equations that define valid transformations. Pure boundary algebra, free of interpretation, is first briefly described, followed by a description of boundary logic. Then several new diagrammatic notations for logic derived from geometrical and topological transformation of boundary forms are presented. The algebra and an example proof of modus ponens is provided for textual, enclosure, graph, map, path and block based forms. These new diagrammatic languages for logic convert connectives into configurations of containment, connectivity, contact, conveyance, and concreteness. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

We draw on established methods used in the space syntax approach to urban design. Here we describe how we have combined scanning for discoverable Bluetooth devices with two such methods, gatecounts and static snapshots. We report our experiences in developing, field testing and refining these augmented methods.

But to find widespread use in photonics technology, MSFs will have to be easily cleavable using mechanical cleavers, since more sophisticated techniques add complexity. In this paper, the very different, yet reproducible cleavage patterns of three high air-fraction, double-clad microstructured fibers are analyzed. Fracture faces reveal the fracture propagation paths and provide measurements of the fracture lengths in the intercapillary bridges. These lengths prove to be always shorter than the critical fracture length predicted by fracture mechanics. A criterion based on critical fracture length is thus proposed to design cleavage-robust MSFs. © 2006 Optical Society of America.

AB  - The use of design patterns in a software system can provide strong indications about the rationale behind the system's design. As a result, automating the detection of design pattern instances could be of significant help to the process of reverse engineering large software systems. In this paper, we introduce DPVK (Design Pattern Verification toolKit), the first reverse engineering tool to detect pattern instances in Eiffel systems. DPVK is able to detect several different design patterns by examining both the static structure and the dynamic behaviour of a system written in Eiffel. We present three case studies that were performed to assess DPVK's effectiveness. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - We present an overview of SPQR, the System for Pattern Query and Recognition, a toolkit that detects instances of known design patterns directly from object-oriented source code in an automated and flexible manner. Based on our previous work in ρ-calculus and Pattern/Object Markup Language (POML), SPQR is retargetable to most OO languages, and system design notations. We discuss how this approach may he applied to architectural concerns by leveraging SPQR's training mode. The System for Pattern Query and Recognition, or SPQR, is an automated framework to analyze software systems in the small or the large, and detect instances of known programming concepts in a flexible yet formal manner. These concepts, combined in well-defined ways to form abstractions, as found in the design patterns literature, then lead to the possible automated detection of design patterns directly from source code and other design artifacts. Our previous publications [7, 8] have described SPQR in detail, as well as its successful application to a number of software systems. Here we describe SPQR briefly, and how these principles can be extended to architectural analysis. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - The decomposition of design patterns into simpler elements may reduce significantly the creation of variants in forward engineering, while it increases the possibility of identifying applied patterns in reverse engineering. Nevertheless, there are few reverse engineering tools that exploit the decomposition of patterns (i.e., FUJABA, SPQR). The SPQR approach introduces a catalog of elemental design patterns (EDP) and a rule set based on sigma-calculus through which EDPs are defined and composed into design patterns. Considering the SPQR approach particularly interesting, we propose a novel solution for defining and detecting EDPs and, further, design patterns. Our approach defines EDPs as logical functions of eight symbolic variables, each variable representing a method call (e.g., method name, method signature, method declaration, this reference, super reference) or a class property (superclass, same family, same object). An EDP detector has been developed based on this approach, representing a starting point for future developments towards design pattern recognition in the reverse engineering context. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Identification of design patterns from source code is one of the most promising methods for improving software maintainability and reusing design experience. In this paper, an approach of detecting design patterns from Java source code is presented. Concretely, the method of specifying design patterns and the mechanism of defining a source information model are provided. Through matching pattern description and source information model, an algorithm for detecting pattern instances from legacy system is illustrated with examples. Especially, the container problem coming across in design pattern detection is identified and resolved through our approach. Finally, the results of applying our approach are analyzed and further optimizing steps are discussed according to the relation between design patterns and design pattern instances.

Guidelines and patterns are discussed and shown to stop short of fulfilling certain usability requirements, especially those of the business user. After justifying the need and usefulness of the UTA, we propose an initial UTA framework. The Usability Requirements, Design Sample and Object component(s)/ Application components are the three parameters that make out the UTA framework providing the user with: 1) Better understanding of both the guidelines and the patterns. 2) Better applicability. 3) Ease of organizational learning. 4) The understanding of the business process and mission. 5) The understanding of the role of marketing goals and priorities in the design. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Interleaved Reed-Solomon codes allow the correction of errors beyond half the minimum code distance if the errors are not distributed independently in the received signal but occur in bursts. Therefore, these codes are mainly considered for applications in channels, that cause correlated error patterns, i.e., error bursts. However, they can also be quite interesting for memoryless channels causing independent random errors, if they are applied in concatenated code designs. We present such concatenated codes with several outer Reed-Solomon codewords and demonstrate the gain, that can be obtained by interleaved Reed-Solomon decoding in comparison to independently decoding the several words of the underlying Reed-Solomon codes. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - This paper addresses the designers' activity and in particular the way designers express an object shape in 2D sketches through character lines and how these lines form a basis for sketching shapes in 3D. The tools currently available in commercial CAS/CAD systems to manipulate the digital models are still not sufficiently suited to support design. In this paper, the so-called fully free-form deformation features (δ-F4) are introduced as a modelling method to take into account the curve-oriented stylists' way of working. Both the advantages of a free-form surface deformation method and a feature-based approach are merged to define these high-level modelling entities allowing for a direct manipulation of surfaces through a limited number of intuitive parameters. Such features incorporate several characteristics designed to handle the uncertainties and/or inconsistencies of the designer's input during a sketching activity. In addition, a δ-F4 classification is proposed to enable a fast access to the desired shape according to its semantics and characteristics. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are languages tailored to a specific application domain. They offer substantial gains in expressiveness and ease of use compared with general-purpose programming languages in their domain of application. DSL development is hard, requiring both domain knowledge and language development expertise. Few people have both. Not surprisingly, the decision to develop a DSL is often postponed indefinitely, if considered at all, and most DSLs never get beyond the application library stage. Although many articles have been written on the development of particular DSLs, there is very limited literature on DSL development methodologies and many questions remain regarding when and how to develop a DSL. To aid the DSL developer, we identify patterns in the decision, analysis, design, and implementation phases of DSL development. Our patterns improve and extend earlier work on DSL design patterns. We also discuss domain analysis tools and language development systems that may help to speed up DSL development. Finally, we present a number of open problems. © 2005 ACM.

The system design reduces the size of the search space as compared to typical window-location approaches for motif inference. This paper describes the motivation and system design for GAMI, discusses how we have designed the search space and compares this to the search space of other approaches, and presents initial results with data from the literature and from novel tasks. GAMI is able to find a host of putative conserved patterns; possible approaches for validating the utility of the conserved regions are discussed. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents an input test data compression scheme that combines the advantages of weighted pseudorandom testing techniques and LFSR reseeding. The scheme requires low area overhead and the compression achieved is not limited by the LFSR reseeding bounds. The test data storage requirements of both the static and dynamic versions of the proposed scheme are lower than previously published results. The total number of test patterns that need to be applied are much lower than that for any weighted pseudorandom testing or hybrid BIST scheme. Further, the method provides an easy way to trade off between test application time and test data compression. The static version of the scheme can be easily implemented without any modification to the current test generation flow while the dynamic version can be used if the ATPG can be modified. Experimental results on a large industry design show that over 100X compression is achievable by the proposed scheme. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Design patterns present good solutions to frequently occurring problems in object-oriented software design. Thus their correct application in a system's design may significantly improve its internal quality attributes such as reusability and maintainability. In software maintenance the existence of up-to-date documentation is crucial, so the discovery of as yet unknown design pattern instances can help improve the documentation. Hence a reliable design pattern recognition system is very desirable. However, simpler methods (based on pattern matching) may give imprecise results due to the vague nature of the patterns' structural description. In previous work we presented a pattern matching-based system using the Columbus framework with which we were able to find pattern instances from the source code by considering the patterns' structural descriptions only, and therefore we could not identify false hits and distinguish similar design patterns such as State and Strategy. In the present work we use machine learning to enhance pattern mining by filtering out as many false hits as possible. To do so we distinguish true and false pattern instances with the help of a learning database created by manually tagging a large C++ system. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - We explore the theoretical foundations of a "twenty questions" approach to pattern recognition. The object of the analysis is the computational process itself rather than probability distributions (Bayesian inference) or decision boundaries (statistical learning). Our formulation is motivated by applications to scene interpretation in which there are a great many possible explanations for the data, one ("background") is statistically dominant, and it is imperative to restrict intensive computation to genuinely ambiguous regions. The focus here is then on pattern filtering: Given a large set y, of possible patterns or explanations, narrow down the true one Y to a small (random) subset Y̌ ⊂ y, of "detected" patterns to be subjected to further, more intense, processing. To this end, we consider a family of hypothesis tests for Y ∈ A versus the nonspecific alternatives Y ∈ A c. Each test has null type I error and the candidate sets A ⊂ y, are arranged in a hierarchy of nested partitions. These tests are then characterized by scope (|A|), power (or type II error) and algorithmic cost. We consider sequential testing strategies in which decisions are made iteratively, based on past outcomes, about which test to perform next and when to stop testing. The set Y̌ is then taken to be the set of patterns that have not been ruled out by the tests performed. The total cost of a strategy is the sum of the "testing cost" and the "postprocessing cost" (proportional to |Y̌|) and the corresponding optimization problem is analyzed. As might be expected, under mild assumptions good designs for sequential testing strategies exhibit a steady progression from broad scope coupled with low power to high power coupled with dedication to specific explanations. In the assumptions ensuring this property a key role is played by the ratio cost/power. These ideas are illustrated in the context of detecting rectangles amidst clutter. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2005.

AB  - Calculating with graphs and relations has many applications in the analysis of software systems, for example, the detection of design patterns or patterns of problematic design and the computation of design metrics. These applications require an expressive query language, in particular, for the detection of graph patterns, and an efficient evaluation of the queries even for large graphs. In this paper, we introduce RML, a simple language for querying and manipulating relations based on predicate calculus, and CrocoPat. an interpreter for RML programs. RML is general because it enables the manipulation not only of graphs (i.e., binary relations), but of relations of arbitrary arity. CrocoPat executes RML programs efficiently because it internally represents relations as binary decision diagrams, a data structure that is well-known as a compact representation of large relations in computer-aided verification. We evaluate RML by giving example programs for several software analyses and CrocoPat by comparing its performance with calculators for binary relations, a Prolog system and a relational database management system. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - This work explores automatic object recognition and semantic capture in vector graphics through shape description. The low-level graphical content of graphical documents, such as a map or architectural drawing, are often captured manually and the encoding of the semantic content seen as an extension of this. The large quantity of new and archived graphical data available on paper makes automatic structuring of such graphical data desirable. Contour shape description techniques, such as Fourier descriptors, moment invariants play an important role in systems for object recognition and representation. However, most work carried out in this area has concentrated on categories of object boundaries representing very specific shapes (for example, a particular type of aircraft). Two classifiers were implemented and proved accurate in their automatic recognition of objects from drawings in different domains. Classical classifier combination techniques were used to improve performance. Further work will employ more complex fusion techniques and it is envisaged they will be used in combination with recognition based on object context using various modelling methods. A demonstration system has been constructed using all these techniques. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - This paper deals with plain figures on the architectural drawings of apartment. This kind of architectural drawings consist of main walls represented by two parallel bold lines, symbols (door, window, tile...), dimension line, extension line, and dimensions represent various numerical values and characters. This paper suggests a method for recognizing main wall which is a backbone of apartment in an architectural drawing. In this thesis, the following modules are realized: an efficient image binarization, a removal of thin lines, a vectorization of detected lines, a region bounding for main walls, a calculation of extension lines, a finding main walls based on extension line, and a field expansion by searching other main walls which are linked with the detected main walls. Although the windows between main walls are not represented as main walls, a detection module for the windows is considered during the recognition period. So the windows are found as a part of main wall. An experimental result on 9 different architectural drawings shows 96.5% recognition of main walls and windows, which is about 5.8% higher than that of Karl Tombre. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - World Wide Web is a global information network that affects many fields of our lives. The distributed, interlinked, visual and heterogeneous structure of the web makes it an irregular development environment. In this paper we propose a pattern based approach for increasing the effectiveness of development for the Web environment. This approach is based on the representation of the core meaning of each design as a set of patterns and requires the formulation of abstract solutions in a mathematical precision. This way not only reusable design experience will be codified unambiguously, but a smooth transition between the design and implementation phases will be realized.

AB  - Web usage mining is the process of extracting interesting patterns from web logs. This paper proposes an IPA (Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules) model for web usage mining in the EC (Electronic Commerce) environment. The IPA model takes both the traveling and purchasing behaviors of customers into consideration at the same time to overcome the disadvantages of the pure association rule mining and pure path traversal pattern mining. The IPA model considers not only user traversal forward information but also backward information. Besides, web structure is also used in this paper to prune unnecessary candidates. Especially, the IPA model allows the noise exist in web transactions. The experimental results show that the IPA model can correctly capture the user's traversing and purchasing behaviors.

AB  - High-quality β-sialon ceramic powders were synthesized by carbothermal reduction nitridation (CRN) using clay mineral as primary raw materials. The thermodynamic reaction mechanism, phase composition and microstructure of the materials, as well as the optimization of its process under multi-variable coupling participation were investigated. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the phases in samples during heat treatment with the increase of sintering temperature will transform from any impurity phases including O' phase and X phase to β phase, and from β phase even to other high-temperature nitride phase involving 15 R, 12 H-sialon, and Si3N4, AlN. So it may result in the complexity in designing for optimal synthesized process. The analysis of orthogonal test indicates that the obtaining of high content of β-sialon with elongated grains depends significantly on both the holding time and sintering temperature. The optimizing zone of performance can be rapidly found by pattern recognition. The 100% sialon phase material is obtained by sintering at 1500°C for 5 h. Based on inverse mapping and artificial neural network, the newly required parameter and its relevant performance can reasonably be predicted.

AB  - Recently, the critical dimension (CD) abnormality due to lens aberrations of exposure tool has become one of the critical issues in production of semiconductor devices. The most remarkable feature of CD abnormality due to lens aberration is asymmetry of symmetric twin pattern. And the asymmetry is only caused by a particular aberration because the influence on CD abnormality of lens aberration depends on the device pattern shape. Therefore, it is important to know the interaction of the device pattern shape with lens aberrations, and to ensure that consideration of the interaction is reflected in the design of device. This paper introduces a pattern design methods robust to lens aberration is based on Zernike Sensitivity (ZS) method. We conclude that our method modifies a pattern sensitive to lens aberration so that it becomes a pattern robust to lens aberration without reduction of the depth of focus (DOF).

AB  - Generation of ATPG patterns require a gate-level simulation model and associated constraints. If the models and the related constraints used to generate patterns are erroneous, then the patterns will likely fail on Silicon. The process of debugging pattern failures on silicon using manual reason in the absence of automated techniques is very time consuming. Further, techniques used for automated defect diagnosis cannot be directly applied to this problem. In this paper we present techniques for debugging ATPG patterns failing on silicon. An automated tool that implements these techniques and is capable of debugging most common errors found in ATPG models and constraints is presented. Results from applying the capability on Intel Pentium-4 processor's ATPG patterns are presented.

RA includes set-theoretic modeling of relations and information-theoretic modeling of frequency and probability distribution. It thus encompasses both statistical and nonstatistical problems. It overlaps with logic design and machine learning in engineering and with log-linear modeling in the social sciences. Its generality gives it considerable potential for knowledge representation and data mining.

AB  - The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is being developed to provide navigation to support aircraft landings for the U.S. military. One variant of JPALS is the Shipboard Relative GPS (SRGPS), which will be implemented on an aircraft carrier. In order to meet strict accuracy, integrity, continuity, and availability goals in the presence of hostile jamming and in a harsh multipath environment, advanced technologies are required. One of those being studied is a controlled reception pattern antenna (CRPA) array with beam steering/adaptive null forming capabilities. The Stanford University GPS Laboratory has developed a software tool to study CRPA algorithms and their effects on GPS signal and tracking characteristics. A testbed has been constructed to investigate hardware issues including the phase center offset of the antenna elements and mutual coupling effects. This testbed consists of a 3 element antenna array with a baseline of 1m, using high-quality survey-grade or lower-quality patch antennas. Data has been taken using this array in conjunction with sufficient satellite constellation and antenna array motion to ensure complete azimuth and elevation signal coverage. A carrier phase-based attitude determination algorithm was used to generate inter-antenna bias residuals, allowing characterization of the virtual phase center of the array. Repeating the testing procedure both with survey-grade antennas, for which the phase center characteristics are well known, and with a patch antenna possessing unknown phase center behavior, allows characterization of the azimuth- and elevation-dependent properties of the patch antenna phase center. In addition, mutual coupling effects have been investigated by adding inactive patch elements around the active patch antenna. All results are compared to predictions from detailed simulation of the patch antenna used using an EM modeling software package.

AB  - Recent research suggests that there are large variations in a cache's spatial usage, both within and across programs. Unfortunately, conventional caches typically employ fixed cache line sizes to balance the exploitation of spatial and temporal locality, and to avoid prohibitive cache fill bandwidth demands. The resulting inability of conventional caches to exploit spatial variations leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary cache power dissipation. This paper describes the Spatial Pattern Predictor (SPP), a cost-effective hardware mechanism that accurately predicts reference patterns within a spatial group (i.e., a contiguous region of data in memory) at runtime. The key observation enabling an accurate, yet low-cost, SPP design is that spatial patterns correlate well with instruction addresses and data reference offsets within a cache line. We require only a small amount of predictor memory to store the predicted patterns. Simulation results for a 64-Kbyte 2-way set-associative L1 data cache with 64-byte lines show that: (1) a 256-entry tag-less direct-mapped SPP can achieve, on average, a prediction coverage of 95%, over-predicting the patterns by only 8%, (2) assuming a 70nm process technology, the SPP helps reduce leakage energy in the base cache by 41% on average, incurring less than 1% performance degradation, and (3) prefetching spatial groups of up to 512 bytes using SPP improves execution time by 33% on average and up to a factor of two.

AB  - Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are stochastic models widely used in speech and image processing in recent years. The number of states in a classical HMMs is usually predefined and fixed during training, and may be quite different from the real number of hidden states of the signal source. Moreover, in pattern recognition applications, different signal sources probably have different state numbers, thereby cannot be well modeled by HMMs with a fixed state number. This paper proposes a self-adaptive design method of HMMs to overcome this limitation. According to this design, an HMM automatically matches its state number to the real state number of the signal source being modeled. To realize a practicable training algorithm for the new HMM, this paper first introduces an entropic definition of the a priori probability of the model and accordingly a maximum a posteriori (MAP) training strategy, and then designs an MAP training algorithm in the case of fixed state number based on the deterministic annealing (DA) technique. Based on this MAP training, a complete training method named shrink algorithm is finally proposed for the new HMM. Experimental results indicate that self-adaptive HMMs can model stochastic signals more accurately and have better performance in pattern recognition than classical models. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many analyses of software systems can be formalized as relational queries, for example the detection of design patterns, of patterns of problematic design, of code clones, of dead code, and of differences between the as-built and the as-designed architecture. This paper describes the concepts of CrocoPat, a tool for querying and manipulating relations. CrocoPat is easy to use, because of its simple query and manipulation language based on predicate calculus, and its simple file format for relations. CrocoPat is efficient, because it internally represents relations as binary decision diagrams, a data structure that is well-known as a compact representation of large relations in computer-aided verification. CrocoPat is general, because it manipulates not only graphs (i.e. binary relations), but n-ary relations.

AB  - Diffusion of dyes in ink-jet prints under high humidity is one of the major causes of print degradation. There is, however, no agreed method how to characterize humidity sensitivity and how to predict failure from accelerated test. The study comprises humidity degradation tests of various ink sets on polymer, porous and nanoporous IJ media. It compares different test patterns, pre-conditioning methods, test conditions, and metrics for humidity. From the extended test set, conclusion could be drawn about the media factors that are most important for humidity degradation, namely the type of colorants, the class of media or the ink vehicle. Some recommendations about test patterns and test methods are discussed.

AB  - Design patterns provide a medium-grained abstraction and can be used as an effective tool for understanding object-oriented systems. This paper presents a simple tool for the extraction of design information from C++ code using design patterns. The design of the tool's model is based on logic-programming approach. This approach extracts design information by using relationships detection algorithm and identifies design patterns from information generated from source code and runtime system. The extraction of design information is separated from design pattern detection in order to facilitate flexibility. This way, the logic programs for identifying design patterns is language-independent while the detection algorithm of the relationships among classes is language-specific. The approach in this paper can effectively reduce false positives and negatives thereby improving the precision of pattern detection.

AB  - Pattern-based design improvement helps designers to locate possible bad design and provide suggestions for improvements base on known good patterns. While researchers have proposed algorithms for recognizing bad patterns in design, they did not consider composition of design pattern instances. In practice, designers compose design pattern instances in solving their design problems. In this paper, we illustrate that good pattern instances can be composed to result in bad ones, while bad pattern instances can be composed to result in good ones. Based on this argument, a pattern-based design improvement approach should be able to recognize composite design patterns instead of just design patterns. As a basis for developing this type of approaches, we suggest a hierarchical model to capture the composite relationships among good and bad patterns. In addition, we define a concept called refinement pattern, which captures possible improvements to bad patterns. This hierarchical model can offer a number of advantages, including rejection of non-informative constituent pattern instances, compactness in the representation of design patterns, reducing complexity in pattern matching by reducing number of constraints to be matched and providing improvement suggestions to bad patterns.

AB  - CD requirements for advanced photomasks are getting very demanding for the 100 nm-node and below; the ITRS roadmap requires CD uniformities below 10 nm for the most critical layers. To reach this goal, statistical as well as systematic CD contributions must be minimized. Here, we focus on the reduction of systematic CD variations across the masks that may be caused by process effects, e.g. dry etch loading. We address this topic by compensating such effects via design data correction analogous to proximity correction. Dry etch loading is modeled by gaussian convolution of pattern densities. Data correction is done geometrically by edge shifting. As the effect amplitude has an order of magnitude of 10 nm this can only be done on e-beam writers with small address grids to avoid big CD steps in the design data. We present modeling and correction results for special mask patterns with very strong pattern density variations showing that the compensation method is able to reduce CD uniformity by 50 - 70% depending on pattern details. The data correction itself is done with a new module developed especially to compensate long-range effects and fits nicely into the common data flow environment. For advanced photomasks the mask data preparation times have become a major issue. To tackle this fracture time increase distributed processing has been introduced into the photomask design flow. We also report first results on the fracture time reduction achievable by distributing the data correction onto a Linux cluster.

AB  - A novel multipoint Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) is presented. The instrument described enables the non-contact measurement of vibration at 16 points simultaneously. Vibration displacement and velocity time histories are both provided as output data. This system offers benefits over existing scanning products in that 16 points are simultaneously investigated, phase information is not lost between measurement points and that efficient data compression allows easy visualization of the dynamics of the surface under test. As a result, transient phenomena on multiple points can be investigated; vibration of damped materials can be accurately measured and power flow through composite structures analyzed. An example of its application on a classical guitar is presented in this paper.

AB  - To improve efficiency of compressed image retrieval, we propose a novel statistical feature extraction algorithm in this paper to characterize the image content directly in its compressed domain. The statistical feature extracted is mainly through computing a set of moments directly from DCT coefficients without involving full decompression or inverse DCT. Following the algorithm design, a content-based image retrieval system is implemented especially targeting retrieving joint picture expert group compressed images. Theoretical analysis and experimental results support that the system is robust to translation, rotation and scale transform with minor disturbance, and the system achieves good performances in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.

AB  - The shoeprint impressions of suspect left at the crime scene can sometimes tell investigators what type of shoes to be looked for. These shoeprint impressions as one of the important evidence are useful in the detection of criminals. In this paper we propose a novel technique for identifying and analyzing the 3D characteristics of shoeprint impressions. We also design 3D shoeprint impression analysis system based on the combination the 3D shape measurement with structured illumination and fringe pattern analysis. We give a detail discussion on the principle and configuration of the system. Laboratory experiments show the technique is efficient in the detection of shoeprint and in the offering the reference for judicial evidence.

AB  - The grade of membership function for fuzzy monotone functions is defined and investigated. An algorithm for finding the membership value is presented. A minterm even function and minterm odd function are defined and studied. It is found that these two functions are the two most alternation functions. The relationships with threshold functions are also presented. In addition, three ways to implement a fuzzy monotone increasing function are investigated. Applications to function representation, data compression and error detection are illustrated. The results have useful applications in fuzzy logic, expert systems, fuzzy expert systems, and also management of uncertainty.

AB  - The main contribution of this work is to show that a number of fundamental and seemingly unrelated problems in database design, pattern recognition, robotics, computational geometry, and image processing can be solved simply and elegantly by stating them as instances of a unifying algorithmic framework that we call the Multiple Query problem. The Multiple Query problem (MQ, for short) is a 5-tuple (Q, A, D, φ, ⊕), where Q is a set of queries, A is a set of items, D is a set of solutions, φ: Q × A → D is a function, and ⊕ is a commutative and associative binary operator over D. The input to the MQ problem consists of a sequence Q = 〈q 1, q 2,..., q m〉 of m queries from Q and of a sequence A = 〈a 1, a 2,... a n〉 of n items from A. The goal is to compute, for every query q i (1 ≤ i ≤ m) its solution defined as φ(q i, A) = φ(q i,a 1) ⊕ φ(q i, a 2) ⊕...⊕ φ(q i, a n). We begin by discussing a generic algorithm that solves a large class of MQ problems in O(√m + f(n)) time on a reconfigurable mesh of size √n × √n, where f(n) is the time necessary to compute the expression d 1 ⊕ d 2 ⊕...⊕ d n with d i ∈ D on such a platform. We then go on to show that the MQ framework affords us an optimal algorithm for the multiple point location problem on a reconfigurable mesh of size √n × √n. Given a set A of n points and a set Q of m (m ≤ n) points in the plane, our algorithm reports, in O(√m + log log n) time, all points of Q that lie inside the convex hull of A. Quite surprisingly, our algorithm solves the multiple point location problem without computing the convex hull of A which, in itself, takes Ω(√n) time on a reconfigurable mesh of size √n × √n. Finally, we prove an Ω(√m + g(n)) time lower bound for nontrivial MQ problems, where g(n) is the lower bound for evaluating the expression d 1 ⊕ d 2 ⊕...⊕ d n with d i ∈ D, on a reconfigurable mesh of size √n × √n.

AB  - The major contribution of this paper is the application of modern analysis techniques to the important Message Passing Interface standard, work done in order to obtain information useful in designing both application programmer interfaces for object-oriented languages, and message passing systems. Recognition of 'Design Patterns' within MPI is an important discernment of this work. A further contribution is a comparative discussion of the design and evolution of three actual object-oriented designs for the Message Passing Interface (MPI-1) application programmer interface (API), two of which have influenced the standardization of C++ explicit parallel programming with MPI-2, and which strongly indicate the value of a priori object-oriented design and analysis of such APIs. Knowledge of design patterns is assumed herein. Discussion provided here includes systems developed at Mississippi State University (MPI++), the University of Notre Dame (OOMPI), and the merger of these systems that results in a standard binding within the MPI-2 standard. Commentary concerning additional opportunities for further object-oriented analysis and design of message passing systems and APIs, such as MPI-2 and MPI/RT, are mentioned in conclusion. Connection of modern software design and engineering principles to high performance computing programming approaches is a new and important further contribution of this work.

AB  - This paper presents a case study in low-cost non-invasive Built-in Self Test (BIST) for RAPPID, a large-scale 120,000-transistor asynchronous version of the Pentium® Pro Instruction Length Decoder, which runs at 3.6 GHz. RAPPID uses a synchronous 0.25 micron CMOS library for static and domino logic, and has no Design-for-Test hooks other than some debug features. We explore the use of Cellular Automata (CA) for on-chip test pattern generation and response evaluation. More specifically, we look for fast ways to tune the CA-BIST to the RAPPID design, rather than using pseudo-random testing. The metric for tuning the CA-BIST pattern generation is based on an abstract hardware description model of the instruction length decoder, which is independent of implementation details, and hence also independent of the asynchronous circuit style. Our CA-BIST solution uses a novel bootstrap procedure for generating the test patterns, which give complete coverage for this metric, and cover 94% of the testable stuck-at faults for the actual design at switch level. Analysis of the undetected and untestable faults shows that the same fault effects can be expected for a similar clocked circuit. This is encouraging evidence that testability is no excuse to avoid asynchronous design techniques in addition to high-performance synchronous solutions. © 2000 IEEE.
